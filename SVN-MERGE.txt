Apache Tomcat re-uses code from a number of other Apache projects. There are
several reasons why depending on the binary releases of those projects is not
ideal. These include:
- potential conflicts if a web application ships with the same JAR
- a large JAR where Tomcat only depends on a small fraction

There are various approaches taken to dealing with this. One of those approaches
is to svn copy the classes to the Tomcat source tree, modify them (always with a
package rename, sometimes with additional changes) and then keep them in sync
with the original via regular svn merges. This file keeps track of these copies
to assist committers in keeping them up to date.

BCEL
org.apache.tomcat.util.bcel is copied from:
/commons/proper/bcel/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/bcel6

DBCP
org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp2 is copied from:
/commons/proper/dbcp/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
and
/commons/proper/dbcp/trunk/src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.pool2 is copied from:
/commons/proper/pool/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/pool2

FileUpload
org.apache.tomcat.util.http.fileupload is copied from:
/commons/proper/fileupload/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/fileupload
Note: Tomcat's copy of fileupload also includes classes copied manually (rather
      than svn copied) from Commons IO.

Codec
org.apache.tomcat.util.codec is copied from:
/commons/proper/codec/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/
Note: Only classes required for Base64 encoding/decoding. The rest are removed.
