            Running The Apache Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@ Servlet/JSP Container
            ===================================================

Apache Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@ requires the Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 6.0 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 6.0 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 6.0 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use the full JDK rather than just the JRE. In this
      case set you have to configure your environment variables
      differently - see below.


(2) Download and Install the Tomcat Binary Distribution

(2.1) Download a binary distribution of Tomcat from:

      http://tomcat.apache.org/

(2.2) Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
      distribution resides in its own directory (conventionally named
      "apache-tomcat-[version]").

      For the purposes of the remainder of this document, the name
      "CATALINA_HOME" is used to refer to the full pathname of the release
      directory.

NOTE:  As an alternative to downloading a binary distribution, you can
create your own from the Tomcat source code, as described in
"BUILDING.txt".  You can either

  a)  Do the full "release" build and find the created distributive in the
      "output/release" directory and then proceed with unpacking as above, or

  b)  Do a simple build and use the "output/build" directory as
      "CATALINA_HOME".  Be warned that there are some differences between
      contents of "output/build" and the official "release" distributive.


(3) Configure Environment Variables

Tomcat itself is a Java application and does not use environment variables,
but the startup scripts use them to prepare the command that starts Tomcat.
The full list of supported environment variables is provided as a comment
at the top of catalina.bat (Windows) and catalina.sh (Unix) files.

(3.1) CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE

The CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE environment variables are used to
specify location of Tomcat itself and of its active configuration
respectively.

The CATALINA_HOME environment variable should be set as defined in (2.2)
above. The startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent (based on the location of the script in
Unixes and on the current directory in Windows), but it might be not
perfect.

The CATALINA_BASE environment variable is optional and is further described
in "Multiple Tomcat Instances" section below. If it is not set it defaults
to be equal to CATALINA_HOME.

(3.2) JRE_HOME and other variables

The third and the last environment variable that is needed to start Tomcat
specifies location of JRE or JDK that should be used to start Tomcat.

There are two different names of this variable, depending on whether JRE or
JDK is used. Use the JRE_HOME variable to specify location of a JRE and
JAVA_HOME variable to specify location of a JDK.

All variables except CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE can be configured in a
setenv.bat (Windows) or setenv.sh (Unix) file. The setenv file can be either
in CATALINA_BASE/bin or in CATALINA_HOME/bin. If both are present, only the
one in CATALINA_BASE is used.

So, either set JRE_HOME variable by yourselves or create the file. For
example,

On Windows, %CATALINA_BASE%\bin\setenv.bat:

  set "JRE_HOME=%ProgramFiles%\Java\jre6"
  exit /b 0

On Unix, $CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh:

  JRE_HOME=/usr/java/latest


(4) Start Up Tomcat

(4.1) Tomcat can be started by executing one of the following commands:

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup.bat         (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh           (Unix)

   or

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\catalina.bat start  (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh start    (Unix)

(4.2) After startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat will be
      available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8080/

(4.3) Further information about configuring and running Tomcat can be found in
      the documentation included here, as well as on the Tomcat web site:

      http://tomcat.apache.org/


(5) Shut Down Tomcat

(5.1) Tomcat can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\shutdown.bat       (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh         (Unix)

   or

      %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\catalina.bat stop  (Windows)

      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh stop    (Unix)

==================================================
Advanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances
==================================================

In many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat
binary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server.  To make
this possible, you can set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable to the
directory that contains the files for your 'personal' Tomcat instance.

When running with separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files
and directories are split as following:

In CATALINA_BASE:

 * bin  - Only the following files:

           * setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows),
           * tomcat-juli.jar

          The setenv scripts were described above. The tomcat-juli library
          is documented in the Logging chapter in the User Guide.

 * conf - Server configuration files (including server.xml)

 * lib  - Libraries and classes

 * logs - Log and output files

 * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications

 * work - Temporary working directories for web applications

 * temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)


In CATALINA_HOME:

 * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts

          The following files will be used only if they are absent in
          CATALINA_BASE/bin:

          setenv.sh (*nix), setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar

 * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below

 * endorsed - Libraries that override standard "Endorsed Standards"
          libraries provided by JRE. See Classloading documentation
          in the User Guide for details.

          By default this "endorsed" directory is absent.

In the default configuration the JAR libraries and classes both in
CATALINA_BASE/lib and in CATALINA_HOME/lib will be added to the common
classpath, but the ones in CATALINA_BASE will be added first and thus will
be searched first.

The idea is that you may leave the standard Tomcat libraries in
CATALINA_HOME/lib and add other ones such as database drivers into
CATALINA_BASE/lib.

In general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,
but put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications. See
Classloading documentation in the User Guide for details.


It might be useful to note that the values of CATALINA_HOME and
CATALINA_BASE can be referenced in the XML configuration files processed
by Tomcat as ${catalina.home} and ${catalina.base} respectively.

For example, the standard manager web application can be kept in
CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager and loaded into CATALINA_BASE by using
the following trick:

 * Copy the CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
   file as CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/manager.xml

 * Add docBase attribute as shown below.

The file will look like the following:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <Context docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager"
    antiResourceLocking="false" privileged="true" >
  </Context>

See Deployer chapter in User Guide and Context and Host chapters in the
Configuration Reference for more information on contexts and web
application deployment.


================
Troubleshooting
================

There are only really 3 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone
Tomcat install:

(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that
    matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that
    Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:

       $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml

    and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is
    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser
    access to bind under UNIX.

    Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the "8080"
    in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the
    port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your browser.

(2) An "out of environment space" error when running the batch files in
    Windows 95, 98, or ME operating systems.

    Right-click on the STARTUP.BAT and SHUTDOWN.BAT files.  Click on
    "Properties", then on the "Memory" tab.  For the "Initial environment" field,
    enter in something like 4096.

    After you click apply, Windows will create shortcuts which you can use
    to start and stop the container.

(3) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a
    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your
    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the
    "localhost".

    In Firefox, this is under Tools/Preferences -> Advanced/Network ->
    Connection -> Settings..., and in Internet Explorer it is Tools ->
    Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settings.
