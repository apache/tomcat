  <display-name>Tomcat Servlet 5.0 Tests</display-name>
  <description>
    Provides a web application used by the Tomcat unit tests to ensure that
    Tomcat meets the requirements of the current JSP and Servlet specification
    for web applications that declare that they follow version 5.0 of the
    Servlet specification and version 3.0 of the JSP specification. This
    typically means ensuring that features introduced in later versions of the
    specification do not change the behaviour of applications that declared an
    earlier version of the specification.
