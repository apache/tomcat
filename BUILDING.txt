            Building The Apache Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@ Servlet/JSP Container
            ====================================================

This subproject contains the source code for Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@, a container that
implements the Servlet 3.0 and JSP 2.1 specifications from the Java
Community Process <http://www.jcp.org/>.  In order to build a binary
distribution version of the container from a source distribution,
do the following:


(0) Download and Install a Java Development Kit

* If the JDK is already installed, skip to (1).

* Download a Java Development Kit (JDK) release (version 1.6.x or later) from:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

* Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.

* Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory
  into which you installed the JDK release.


(1) Install Apache Ant 1.8.x on your computer

* If Apache Ant 1.8.x is already installed on your computer, skip to (2).

* Download a binary distribution of Ant 1.8.x from:

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

* Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the
  Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named
  "apache-ant-[version]").  For the purposes of the remainder of this document,
  the symbolic name "${ant.home}" is used to refer to the full pathname of
  the release directory.

* Create an ANT_HOME environment variable to point the directory
  ${ant.home}.

* Modify the PATH environment variable to include the directory
  ${ant.home}/bin in its list.  This makes the "ant" command line script
  available, which will be used to actually perform the build.


(2) Building Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@

(2.1) Checkout or obtain the source code for Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@

* Tomcat SVN repository URL:
  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@.x/

* Download a source package from:
  http://tomcat.apache.org/download-@VERSION_MAJOR@0.cgi

* Checkout the source using SVN, selecting the desired version or
  branch (current development source is at
  http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tomcat/tc@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@.x/trunk/), or
  unpack the source package. The location where the source has been
  placed will be referred as ${tomcat.source}.

(2.2) Building

* Go to that directory, and do:

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant

* NOTE: Users accessing the Internet through a proxy must use a properties
  file to indicate to Ant the proxy configuration. Read below.

* WARNING: Running this command will download binaries to the /usr/share/java
  directory. Make sure this is appropriate to do on your computer. On Windows,
  this usually corresponds to the "C:\usr\share\java" directory, unless Cygwin
  is used. Read below to customize the directory used to download the binaries.

* The build can be controlled by creating a ${tomcat.source}/build.properties
  file, and adding the following content to it:

    # ----- Proxy setup -----
    # Uncomment if using a proxy server
    #proxy.host=proxy.domain
    #proxy.port=8080
    #proxy.use=on

    # ----- Default Base Path for Dependent Packages -----
    # Replace this path with the directory path where dependencies binaries
    # should be downloaded
    base.path=/usr/share/java


(3) Updating sources

It is recommended that you regularly update the downloaded Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@ sources
using your SVN client.

(4) Rebuilds

For a quick rebuild of only modified code you can use:

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant

(5) Building the servlet and jsp API documentation

The documentation can be easly built:

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant javadoc

(6) Building the extras (commons-logging, webservices etc.).
    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant extras

(7) Building the embedded packages.
    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant embed

(8) Building a full release (as provided via the ASF download pages):

    cd ${tomcat.source}
    ant release
