  - *.html files in documentation are generated from XML sources

  - *.md5, *.sha/*.sha1 files are generated and cannot contain license

  - *.manifest, MANIFEST.MF JAR manifest files cannot contain license

  - package-list and script.js files in API documentation (javadoc) are
    generated

  - other test files, such as trivial textual files containing only "OK' string,
    files in unusual encodings or compressed files are also excluded.

  - JSON files (RFC7159) are data and cannot contain comments

  - local build configuration files

  - file fragments that are combined during the build process and therefore can
    not contain a license header in every fragment

  - JavaEE XML schemas that are CDDL licensed

  - Checkstyle configuration file that defines how to check for the presence of
    ALv2 headers

  - files used simply to ensure directories are not empty

  - *.bmp, *.dia files are binary
