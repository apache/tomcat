Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (10.0.x)

Items carried over from the 9.0.x list:

 1. Remove the use of system properties to control configuration wherever
    possible.

 2. Reduce instances of setters and getters for the same property existing on an
    object and its parent. This may require new objects to be exposed via JMX.

New items for 10.0.x onwards:

 1. Remove APR connector.

Deferred until 10.1.x:

 1. Remove the ExtensionValidator and associated classes (assuming that the
    minimum Java version is Java 9 or later).

 2. Remove org.apache.tomcat.jni and replace with the minimum necessary to
    interface with OpenSSL and clones.
    We might want to park this one until we see what is available direct from
    the JRE with project Panama.
