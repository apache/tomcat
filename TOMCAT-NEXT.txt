Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (11.x)

 1. Implement OCSP checks for client certs with NIO/NIO2.
    Useful reference:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5161504/ocsp-revocation-on-client-certificate

 2. Integrate Panama OpenSSL module once Java 21 is available. Building Tomcat
    releases would then require at least Java 21.

 3. Add QUIC support using OpenSSL and Panama.

 4. Remove SecurityManager (assuming Jakarta EE 11 does so).

 5. Update minimum Java version to 17 (assuming Jakarta EE 11 does so).

 6. Implement an optional Loom module that provides
    o.a.c.http11.Http11BioLoomProtocol
