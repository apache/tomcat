  <section name="Introduction">

  <p>
    Tomcat supports using the GraalVM/Mandrel Native Image tool to produce
    a native binary including the container. This documentation page
    describes the build process of such an image.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Setup">

  <p>
    The native image tool is much easier to use with single JARs, as a result
    the process will use the Maven shade plugin JAR packaging. The
    idea is to produce a single JAR that contains all necessary classes from
    Tomcat, the webapps and all additional dependencies. Although Tomcat has
    received compatibility fixes to support native images, other libraries
    may not be compatible and may require replacement code (the GraalVM
    documentation has more details about this).
  </p>

  <p>
    Download and install GraalVM or Mandrel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Download the Tomcat Stuffed module from
    <code>https://github.com/apache/tomcat/tree/main/modules/stuffed</code>.
    For convinience, an env property can be set:
    <source>export TOMCAT_STUFFED=/absolute...path...to/stuffed</source>
    The build process now requires both Apache Ant and Maven.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Packaging and Building">

  <p>
    Inside the <code>$TOMCAT_STUFFED</code> folder, the directory structure
    is the same as for regular Tomcat. The main configuration files
    are placed in the <code>conf</code> folder, and if using the default
    <code>server.xml</code> the webapps are placed in the <code>webapps</code>
    folder.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the webapp classes need to be made available to the Maven shade plugin
    as well as the compiler during the JSP precompilation step.
    Any JARs that are present in <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>
    need to be made available as Maven dependencies.
    The <code>webapp-jspc.ant.xml</code> script will copy classes from the
    <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code> folder of the webapp
    to the <code>target/classes</code> path that Maven uses as the compilation
    target, but if any of the JSP sources use them, then they need to be
    packaged as JARs instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first step is to build the shaded Tomcat JAR with all dependencies.
    Any JSP in the webapp must all be precompiled and packaged (assuming
    that the <code>webapps</code> contains a <code>$WEBAPPNAME</code> webapp):
    <source>cd $TOMCAT_STUFFED
mvn package
ant -Dwebapp.name=$WEBAPPNAME -f webapp-jspc.ant.xml</source>
    Dependencies for the webapp should now be added to the main
    <code>$TOMCAT_STUFFED/pom.xml</code>,
    following by building the shaded JAR:
    <source>mvn package</source>
  </p>

  <p>
    As it is best to avoid using reflection whenever possible with Ahead of
    Time compilation, it can be a good idea to generate and compile Tomcat
    Embedded code out of the main server.xml configuration as well as the
    context.xml files used to configure the contexts.
    <source>$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\
        -Dcatalina.base=. -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties\
        -jar target/tomcat-stuffed-1.0.jar --catalina -generateCode src/main/java</source>
    Then stop Tomcat and use the following command to include the generated
    embedded code:
    <source>mvn package</source>
    The rest of the process described here will assume this step was done and
    the <code>--catalina -useGeneratedCode</code> arguments are added to the
    command lines. If this was not the case, they should be removed.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Native image configuration">

  <p>
    Native images do not support any form of dynamic classloading or
    reflection unless it is defined explicitly in descriptors. Generating
    them uses a tracing agent from the GraalVM, and needs additional manual
    configuration in some cases.
  </p>

  <p>
    Run Tomcat using the GraalVM substrate VM and its trace agent:
    <source>$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\
        -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=$TOMCAT_STUFFED/target/\
        -Dorg.graalvm.nativeimage.imagecode=agent\
        -Dcatalina.base=. -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties\
        -jar target/tomcat-stuffed-1.0.jar --catalina -useGeneratedCode</source>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now all paths from the webapp that lead to dynamic classloading
    (ex: Servlet access, websockets, etc) need to be accessed using a script
    that will exercise the webapp. Servlets may be loaded on startup
    instead of needing an actual access. Listeners may also be used to load
    additional classes on startup. When that is done, Tomcat can be stopped.
  </p>

  <p>
    The descriptors have now been generated in the agent output directory.
    At this point, further configuration must be made to add items that are
    not traced, including: base interfaces, resource bundles, BeanInfo based
    reflection, etc. Please refer to the Graal documentation for more
    information on this process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though all classes that are used have to be complied AOT into the
    native image, webapps must still be left unchanged, and continue including
    all needed classes and JARs in the <code>WEB-INF</code> folder. Although
    these classes will not actually be run or loaded, access to them is
    required.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Building the native image">

  <p>
    If everything has been done properly, the native image can now be built
    using the native-image tool.
    <source>$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime\
        --enable-http --enable-https --enable-url-protocols=http,https,jar,jrt\
        --initialize-at-build-time=org.eclipse.jdt,org.apache.el.parser.SimpleNode,jakarta.servlet.jsp.JspFactory,org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperInitializer,org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspFactoryImpl\
        -H:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions\
        -H:+JNI -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces\
        -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=$TOMCAT_STUFFED/target/\
        -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=$TOMCAT_STUFFED/tomcat-reflection.json\
        -H:ResourceConfigurationFiles=$TOMCAT_STUFFED/tomcat-resource.json\
        -H:JNIConfigurationFiles=$TOMCAT_STUFFED/tomcat-jni.json\
        -jar $TOMCAT_STUFFED/target/tomcat-stuffed-1.0.jar</source>
    The additional <code>--static</code> parameter enables static linking of
    glibc, zlib and libstd++ in the generated binary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Running the native image is then:
    <source>./tomcat-stuffed-1.0 -Dcatalina.base=. -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties --catalina -useGeneratedCode</source>
  </p>

  </section>

  <section name="Compatibility">

  <p>
    Servlets, JSPs, EL, websockets, the Tomcat container, tomcat-native, HTTP/2
    are all supported out of the box in a native image.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the time of writing this documentation, JULI is not supported as the
    log manager configuration property is not supported by Graal, in addition
    to some static initializer problems, and the regular java.util.logging
    loggers and implementation should be used instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    If using the default server.xml file, some Server listeners have
    to be removed from the configuration as they are not compatible with native
    images, such as a JMX listener (JMX is unsupported) and leak prevention
    listeners (use of internal code that does not exist in Graal).
  </p>

  <p>
    Missing items for better Tomcat functionality:
    <ul>
      <li>java.util.logging LogManager: Configuration through a system property
        is not implemented, so standard java.util.logging must be used instead
        of JULI</li>
      <li>Static linking configuration: tomcat-native cannot be statically
        linked</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
