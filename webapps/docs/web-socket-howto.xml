<p>Tomcat provides support for WebSocket as defined by

<section name="Application development">
<p>Tomcat implements the Java WebSocket 1.0 API defined by <a
   href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356">JSR-356</a>.</p>

<p>There are several example applications that demonstrate how the WebSocket API
   can be used. You will need to look at both the client side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/websocket/">
   HTML</a> and the server side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/trunk/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/websocket/">
   code</a>.</p>

<section name="Tomcat WebSocket specific configuration">
<p>The JSR-356 Java WebSocket 1.0 implementation is only available when Tomcat
   is running on Java 7 or later.</p>

<p>Tomcat provides a number of Tomcat specific configuration options for
   WebSocket. It is anticipated that these will be absorbed into the WebSocket
   specification over time.</p>

<p>The write timeout used when sending WebSocket messages in blocking mode
   defaults to 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds). This may be changed by setting
   the property <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.BLOCKING_SEND_TIMEOUT</code>
   in the user properties collection attached to the WebSocket session. The
   value assigned to this property should be a <code>Long</code> and represents
   the timeout to use in milliseconds. For an infinite timeout, use
   <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>The default buffer size for binary messages is 8192 bytes. This may be
   changed for a web application by setting the servlet context initialization
   parameter <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.binaryBufferSize</code> to the
   desired value in bytes.</p>

<p>The default buffer size for text messages is 8192 bytes. This may be
   changed for a web application by setting the servlet context initialization
   parameter <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.textBufferSize</code> to the
   desired value in bytes.</p>

<p>The Java WebSocket specification 1.0 does not permit programmatic deployment
   after the first endpoint has started a WebSocket handshake. By default,
   Tomcat continues to permit additional programmatic deployment. This
   behavior is controlled by the
   <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.noAddAfterHandshake</code> servlet context
   initialization parameter. The default may be changed by setting the
   <code>org.apache.tomcat.websocket.STRICT_SPEC_COMPLIANCE</code> system
   property to <code>true</code> but any explicit setting on the servlet context
   will always take priority.</p>

<section name="Deprecated proprietary API">

<p>Prior to the development of JRS-356, Tomcat provided a proprietary WebSocket
   API. This API has been deprecated in Tomcat 7 and will be removed in Tomcat
   8. There is unlikely to be any further development of this proprietary API
   apart from bug fixes.</p>

<p>For information on this API, please see the Javadoc for the
   <a href="api/index.html?org/apache/catalina/websocket/package-summary.html">
   <code>org.apache.catalina.websocket</code></a> package. The Javadoc
   pages are not included with Tomcat binary distributions. To view them
   locally you would have to download and install "Full documentation"
   distribution, or build it from sources. You can
   also read this on the Apache Tomcat web site. Start with the
   <a href="api/index.html?org/apache/catalina/websocket/WebSocketServlet.html">
   <code>WebSocketServlet</code></a> class.</p>

<p>There are also several example applications that demonstrate how the
   WebSocket API can be used. You'll need to look at both the client side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc7.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_7_0_42/webapps/examples/websocket/">
   HTML</a> and the server side <a
   href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc7.0.x/tags/TOMCAT_7_0_42/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/websocket/">
   code</a>. Note that as of 7.0.43, these sample applications have been
   refactored to use the JSR-356 WebSocket implementation so the links above are
   for the 7.0.42 tag.</p>
