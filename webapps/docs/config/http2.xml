<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>HTTP Upgrade Protocol</strong> element represents an
  <strong>Upgrade Protocol</strong> component that supports the HTTP/2 protocol.
  An instance of this component must be associated with an existing
  <a href="http.html">HTTP/1.1 Connector</a>.</p>

  <p>HTTP/2 connectors use non-blocking I/O, only utilising a container thread
  from the thread pool when there is data to read and write. However, because
  the Servlet API is fundamentally blocking, each HTTP/2 stream requires a
  dedicated container thread for the duration of that stream.</p>

  <p>Requests processed using HTTP/2 will have the following additional request
  attributes available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>org.apache.coyote.connectionID</code> will return the HTTP/2
        connection ID</li>
    <li><code>org.apache.coyote.streamID</code> will return the HTTP/2 stream
        ID</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All implementations of <strong>Upgrade Protocol</strong> support the
  following attributes:</p>

    <attribute name="className" required="true">
      <p>This must be <code>org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

  <p>The HTTP/2 <strong>Upgrade Protocol</strong> implementation supports the
  following attributes in addition to the common attributes listed above.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="initialWindowSize" required="false">
      <p>Controls the initial size of the flow control window for streams that
      Tomcat advertises to clients. If not specified, the default value of
      <code>65535</code> is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keepAliveTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The time, in milliseconds, that Tomcat will wait between HTTP/2 frames
      when there is no active Stream before closing the connection. Negative
      values will be treated as an infinite timeout. If not specified, a default
      value of <code>20000</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxConcurrentStreamExecution" required="false">
      <p>The controls the maximum number of streams for any one connection that
      can be allocated threads from the container thread pool. If more streams
      are active than threads are available, those streams will have to wait
      for a stream to become available. If not specified, the default value of
      <code>20</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxConcurrentStreams" required="false">
      <p>The controls the maximum number of active streams permitted for any one
      connection. If a client attempts to open more active streams than this
      limit, the stream will be reset with a <code>STREAM_REFUSED</code> error.
      If not specified, the default value of <code>100</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHeaderCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of headers in a request that is allowed by the
      container. A request that contains more headers than the specified limit
      will be rejected. A value of less than 0 means no limit.
      If not specified, a default of 100 is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxTrailerCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of trailer headers in a request that is allowed by
      the container. A request that contains more trailer headers than the
      specified limit will be rejected. A value of less than 0 means no limit.
      If not specified, a default of 100 is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="overheadContinuationThreshold" required="false">
      <p>The threshold below which the payload size of a non-final
      <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame will trigger an increase in the overhead
      count (see <strong>overheadCountFactor</strong>). The overhead count will
      be increased by <code>overheadContinuationThreshold/payloadSize</code> so
      that the smaller the <code>CONTINUATION</code> frame, the greater the
      increase in the overhead count. A value of zero or less disables the
      checking of non-final <code>CONTINUATION</code> frames. If not specified,
      a default value of <code>1024</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="overheadCountFactor" required="false">
      <p>The factor to apply when counting overhead frames to determine if a
      connection has too high an overhead and should be closed. The overhead
      count starts at <code>-10</code>. The count is decreased for each
      data frame sent or received and each headers frame received. The count is
      increased by the <code>overheadCountFactor</code>for each setting
      received, priority frame received and ping received. If the overhead count
      exceeds zero, the connection is closed. A value of less than
      <code>1</code> disables this protection. In normal usage a value of
      <code>3</code> or more will close the connection before any streams can
      complete. If not specified, a default value of <code>1</code> will be
      used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="overheadDataThreshold" required="false">
      <p>The threshold below which the average payload size of the current and
      previous non-final <code>DATA</code> frames will trigger an increase in
      the overhead count (see <strong>overheadCountFactor</strong>). The
      overhead count will be increased by
      <code>overheadDataThreshold/average</code> so that the smaller the
      average, the greater the increase in the overhead count. A value of zero
      or less disables the checking of non-final <code>DATA</code> frames. If
      not specified, a default value of <code>1024</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="overheadWindowUpdateThreshold" required="false">
      <p>The threshold below which the average size of current and previous
      <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frame will trigger an increase in the overhead
      count (see <strong>overheadCountFactor</strong>). The overhead count will
      be increased by <code>overheadWindowUpdateThreshold/average</code> so
      that the smaller the average, the greater the increase in the overhead
      count. A value of zero or less disables the checking of
      <code>WINDOW_UPDATE</code> frames. If not specified, a default value of
      <code>1024</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="readTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The time, in milliseconds, that Tomcat will wait for additional data
      when a partial HTTP/2 frame has been received. Negative values will be
      treated as an infinite timeout. If not specified, a default value of
      <code>5000</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="streamReadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The time, in milliseconds, that Tomcat will wait for additional data
      frames to arrive for the stream when an application is performing a
      blocking I/O read and additional data is required. Negative values will be
      treated as an infinite timeout. If not specified, a default value of
      <code>20000</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="streamWriteTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The time, in milliseconds, that Tomcat will wait for additional window
      update frames to arrive for the stream and/or connection when an
      application is performing a blocking I/O write and the stream and/or
      connection flow control window is too small for the write to complete.
      Negative values will be treated as an infinite timeout. If not specified,
      a default value of <code>20000</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useSendfile" required="false">
      <p>Use this boolean attribute to enable or disable sendfile capability.
      The default value is <code>true</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="writeTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The time, in milliseconds, that Tomcat will wait to write additional
      data when an HTTP/2 frame has been partially written. Negative values will
      be treated as an infinite timeout. If not specified, a default value of
      <code>5000</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>

  <p>The HTTP/2 upgrade protocol will also inherit the following limits from the
  <a href="http.html">HTTP Connector</a> it is nested with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>allowedTrailerHeaders</li>
    <li>compressibleMimeType</li>
    <li>compression</li>
    <li>compressionMinSize</li>
    <li>maxCookieCount</li>
    <li>maxHeaderSize</li>
    <li>maxParameterCount</li>
    <li>maxPostSize</li>
    <li>maxSavePostSize</li>
    <li>maxTrailerSize</li>
