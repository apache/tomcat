<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>CookieProcessor</strong> element represents the component that
  parses received cookie headers into <code>jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie</code>
  objects accessible through <code>HttpServletRequest.getCookies()</code> and
  converts <code>jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie</code> objects added to the response
  through <code>HttpServletResponse.addCookie()</code> to the HTTP headers
  returned to the client.</p>

  <p>A CookieProcessor element MAY be nested inside a
  <a href="context.html">Context</a> component. If it is not included, a default
  implementation will be created automatically.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

    <p>All implementations of <strong>CookieProcessor</strong> support the
    following attributes:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="className" required="false">
        <p>Java class name of the implementation to use. This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.http.CookieProcessor</code>
        interface. If not specified, the standard value (defined below) will be
        used.</p>
      </attribute>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

    <p>The standard implementation of <strong>CookieProcessor</strong> is
    <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Rfc6265CookieProcessor</code>.</p>

    <p>This cookie processor is based on RFC6265 with the following changes to
    support better interoperability:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Values 0x80 to 0xFF are permitted in cookie-octet to support the use
      of UTF-8 in cookie values as used by HTML 5.</li>
      <li>For cookies without a value, the '=' is not required after the name as
      some browsers do not sent it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The RFC 6265 cookie processor is generally more lenient than the legacy
    cookie parser. In particular:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The '<code>=</code>' and '<code>/</code>' characters are always
      permitted in a cookie value.</li>
      <li>Name only cookies are always permitted.</li>
      <li>The cookie header is always preserved.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <strong>RFC 6265 Cookie Processor</strong> supports the following
    additional attributes.</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="sameSiteCookies" required="false">
        <p>Enables setting same-site cookie attribute.</p>

        <p>If value is <code>unset</code> then the same-site cookie attribute
        won't be set. This is the default value.</p>

        <p>If value is <code>none</code> then the same-site cookie attribute
        will be set and the cookie will always be sent in cross-site requests.</p>

        <p>If value is <code>lax</code> then the browser only sends the cookie
        in same-site requests and cross-site top level GET requests.</p>

        <p>If value is <code>strict</code> then the browser prevents sending the
        cookie in any cross-site request.</p>
