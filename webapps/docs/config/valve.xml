<section name="Introduction">

  <p>A <strong>Valve</strong> element represents a component that will be
  inserted into the request processing pipeline for the associated
  Catalina container (<a href="engine.html">Engine</a>,
  <a href="host.html">Host</a>, or <a href="context.html">Context</a>).
  Individual Valves have distinct processing capabilities, and are
  described individually below.</p>

    <blockquote><em>
    <p>The description below uses the variable name $CATALINA_BASE to refer the
    base directory against which most relative paths are resolved. If you have
    not configured Tomcat for multiple instances by setting a CATALINA_BASE
    directory, then $CATALINA_BASE will be set to the value of $CATALINA_HOME,
    the directory into which you have installed Tomcat.</p>

<section name="Access Log Valve">

  <subsection name="Introduction">

    <p>The <strong>Access Log Valve</strong> creates log files in the same
    format as those created by standard web servers.  These logs can later
    be analyzed by standard log analysis tools to track page hit counts,
    user session activity, and so on.  The files produces by this <code>Valve</code>
    are rolled over nightly at midnight.  This <code>Valve</code>
    may be associated with any Catalina container (<code>Context</code>,
    <code>Host</code>, or <code>Engine</code>), and
    will record ALL requests processed by that container.</p>

    <p>Some requests may be handled by Tomcat before they are passed to a
    container. These include redirects from /foo to /foo/ and the rejection of
    invalid requests. Where Tomcat can identify the <code>Context</code> that
    would have handled the request, the request/response will be logged in the 
    <code>AccessLog</code>(s) associated <code>Context</code>, <code>Host</code>
    and <code>Engine</code>. Where Tomcat cannot identify the
    <code>Context</code> that would have handled the request, e.g. in cases
    where the URL is invalid, Tomcat will look first in the <code>Engine</code>,
    then the default <code>Host</code> for the <code>Engine</code> and finally
    the ROOT (or default) <code>Context</code> for the default <code>Host</code>
    for an <code>AccessLog</code> implementation. Tomcat will use the first
    <code>AccessLog</code> implementation found to log those requests that are
    rejected before they are passed to a container.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Attributes">

    <p>The <strong>Access Log Valve</strong> supports the following
    configuration attributes:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="className" required="true">
        <p>Java class name of the implementation to use.  This MUST be set to
        <strong>org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve</strong> to use the
        default access log valve.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="directory" required="false">
        <p>Absolute or relative pathname of a directory in which log files
        created by this valve will be placed.  If a relative path is
        specified, it is interpreted as relative to $CATALINA_BASE.  If
        no directory attribute is specified, the default value is "logs"
        (relative to $CATALINA_BASE).</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="pattern" required="false">
        <p>A formatting layout identifying the various information fields
        from the request and response to be logged, or the word
        <code>common</code> or <code>combined</code> to select a
        standard format.  See below for more information on configuring
        this attribute. Note that the optimized access does only support
        <code>common</code> and <code>combined</code> as the value for this
        attribute.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="prefix" required="false">
        <p>The prefix added to the start of each log file's name.  If not
        specified, the default value is "access_log.".  To specify no prefix,
        use a zero-length string.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="requestAttributesEnabled" required="false">
        <p>Set to <code>true</code> to check for the existance of request
        attributes (typically set by the RemoteIpValve and similar) that should
        be used to override the values returned by the request for remote
        address, remote host, server port and protocol. If the attributes are
        not set, or this attribute is set to <code>false</code> then the values 
        from the request will be used. If not set, the default value of
        <code>false</code> will be used.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="resolveHosts" required="false">
        <p>Set to <code>true</code> to convert the IP address of the remote
        host into the corresponding host name via a DNS lookup.  Set to
        <code>false</code> to skip this lookup, and report the remote IP
        address instead.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="suffix" required="false">
        <p>The suffix added to the end of each log file's name.  If not
        specified, the default value is "".  To specify no suffix,
        use a zero-length string.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="rotatable" required="false">
        <p>Flag to determine if log rotation should occur.
           If set to <tt>false</tt>, then this file is never rotated and
           <tt>fileDateFormat</tt> is ignored. Use with caution!
           Default value: <tt>true</tt>
        </p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="condition" required="false">
        <p>Turns on conditional logging. If set, requests will be
           logged only if <tt>ServletRequest.getAttribute()</tt> is
           null. For example, if this value is set to
           <tt>junk</tt>, then a particular request will only be logged
           if <tt>ServletRequest.getAttribute("junk") == null</tt>.
           The use of Filters is an easy way to set/unset the attribute
           in the ServletRequest on many different requests.
        </p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="fileDateFormat" required="false">
        <p>Allows a customized date format in the access log file name.
           The date format also decides how often the file is rotated.
           If you wish to rotate every hour, then set this value
           to: <tt>yyyy-MM-dd.HH</tt>
        </p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="buffered" required="false">
        <p>Flag to determine if logging will be buffered.
           If set to <tt>false</tt>, then access logging will be written after each 
           request. Default value: <tt>true</tt>
        </p>
      </attribute>

    </attributes>

    <p>Values for the <code>pattern</code> attribute are made up of literal
    text strings, combined with pattern identifiers prefixed by the "%"
    character to cause replacement by the corresponding variable value from
    the current request and response.  The following pattern codes are
    supported:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>%a</b> - Remote IP address</li>
    <li><b>%A</b> - Local IP address</li>
    <li><b>%b</b> - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers, or '-' if zero</li>
    <li><b>%B</b> - Bytes sent, excluding HTTP headers</li>
    <li><b>%h</b> - Remote host name (or IP address if
        <code>resolveHosts</code> is false)</li>
    <li><b>%H</b> - Request protocol</li>
    <li><b>%l</b> - Remote logical username from identd (always returns
        '-')</li>
    <li><b>%m</b> - Request method (GET, POST, etc.)</li>
    <li><b>%p</b> - Local port on which this request was received</li>
    <li><b>%q</b> - Query string (prepended with a '?' if it exists)</li>
    <li><b>%r</b> - First line of the request (method and request URI)</li>
    <li><b>%s</b> - HTTP status code of the response</li>
    <li><b>%S</b> - User session ID</li>
    <li><b>%t</b> - Date and time, in Common Log Format</li>
    <li><b>%u</b> - Remote user that was authenticated (if any), else '-'</li>
    <li><b>%U</b> - Requested URL path</li>
    <li><b>%v</b> - Local server name</li>
    <li><b>%D</b> - Time taken to process the request, in millis</li>
    <li><b>%T</b> - Time taken to process the request, in seconds</li>
    <li><b>%I</b> - current request thread name (can compare later with stacktraces)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    There is also support to write information from the cookie, incoming
    header, the Session or something else in the ServletRequest.
    It is modeled after the apache syntax:
    <ul>
    <li><b><code>%{xxx}i</code></b> for incoming headers</li>
    <li><b><code>%{xxx}o</code></b> for outgoing response headers</li>
    <li><b><code>%{xxx}c</code></b> for a specific cookie</li>
    <li><b><code>%{xxx}r</code></b> xxx is an attribute in the ServletRequest</li>
    <li><b><code>%{xxx}s</code></b> xxx is an attribute in the HttpSession</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p>The shorthand pattern name <code>common</code> (which is also the
    default) corresponds to <strong>'%h %l %u %t "%r" %s %b'</strong>.</p>

    <p>The shorthand pattern name <code>combined</code> appends the
    values of the <code>Referer</code> and <code>User-Agent</code> headers,
    each in double quotes, to the <code>common</code> pattern
    described in the previous paragraph.</p>
