<section name="Introduction">

  <p>A <strong>Listener</strong> element defines a component that performs
  actions when specific events occur, usually Tomcat starting or Tomcat
  stopping.</p>

  <p>Listeners may be nested inside a <a href="server.html">Server</a>,
  <a href="engine.html">Engine</a>, <a href="host.html">Host</a> or
  <a href="context.html">Context</a>. Some Listeners are only intended to be
  nested inside specific elements. These constraints are noted in the
  documentation below.</p>

</section>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

    <p>All implementations of <strong>Listener</strong>
    support the following attributes:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="className" required="true">
        <p>Java class name of the implementation to use. This class must
        implement the <code>org.apache.catalina.LifecycleListener</code>
        interface.</p>
      </attribute>

    </attributes>

  </subsection>

</section>

<section name="Nested Components">

  <p>No element may be nested inside a <strong>Listener</strong>.</p>

</section>

<section name="Standard Implementations">

  <p>Unlike most Catalina components, there are several standard
  <strong>Listener</strong> implementations available.  As a result,
  the <code>className</code> attribute MUST be used to select the
  implementation you wish to use.</p>

  <subsection name="APR Lifecycle Listener - org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener">

    <p>The <strong>APR Lifecycle Listener</strong> checks for the presence of
    the APR/native library and loads the library if it is present. For more
    information see the <a href="../apr.html">APR/native guide</a>.</p>

    <p>This listener must only be nested within <a href="server.html">Server</a>
    elements.</p>

    <p>The following additional attributes are supported by the <strong>APR
    Lifecycle Listener</strong>:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="SSLEngine" required="false">
        <p>Name of the SSLEngine to use. <code>off</code>: do not use SSL,
        <code>on</code>: use SSL but no specific ENGINE.</p>
        <p>The default value is <b>on</b>. This initializes the
        native SSL engine, which must be enabled in the APR/native connector by
        the use of the <code>SSLEnabled</code> attribute.</p>
        <p>See the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">Official OpenSSL website</a>
        for more details on supported SSL hardware engines and manufacturers.
        </p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="SSLRandomSeed" required="false">
        <p>Entropy source used to seed the SSLEngine's PRNG. The default value
        is <code>builtin</code>. On development systems, you may want to set
        this to <code>/dev/urandom</code> to allow quicker start times.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="FIPSMode" required="false">
        <p>Set to <code>on</code> to request that OpenSSL be in FIPS mode
        (if OpenSSL is already in FIPS mode, it will remain in FIPS mode).
        Set to <code>enter</code> to force OpenSSL to enter FIPS mode (an error
        will occur if OpenSSL is already in FIPS mode).
        Set to <code>require</code> to require that OpenSSL <i>already</i> be
        in FIPS mode (an error will occur if OpenSSL is not already in FIPS
        mode).</p>
        <p>FIPS mode <em>requires you to have a FIPS-capable OpenSSL library which
        you must build yourself</em>.
        If this attribute is set to any of the above values, the <b>SSLEngine</b>
        must be enabled as well.</p>
        <p>The default value is <code>off</code>.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="useOpenSSL" required="false">
        <p>This attribute controls the auto-selection of the OpenSSL JSSE
        implementation. The default is <code>true</code> which will use OpenSSL
        if the native library is available and a NIO or NIO2 connector is used.</p>
      </attribute>

    </attributes>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Global Resources Lifecycle Listener - org.apache.catalina.mbeans.GlobalResourcesLifecycleListener">

    <p>The <strong>Global Resources Lifecycle Listener</strong> initializes the
    Global JNDI resources defined in server.xml as part of the <a
    href="globalresources.html">Global Resources</a> element. Without this
    listener, none of the Global Resources will be available.</p>

    <p>This listener must only be nested within <a href="server.html">Server</a>
    elements.</p>

    <p>No additional attributes are supported by the <strong>Global Resources
    Lifecycle Listener</strong>.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="JNI Library Loading Listener - org.apache.catalina.core.JniLifecycleListener">

    <p>The <strong>JNI Library Loading Listener</strong> makes it possible
    for multiple Webapps to use a native library, by loading the native
    library using a shared class loader (typically the Common class loader but
    may vary in some configurations)</p>

    <p>The listener supports two mutually exclusive attributes, so one of them must be used, but you can not use both together:</p>

    <attributes>
      <attribute name="libraryName" required="false">
        <p>The name of the native library, as defined in
        <code>java.lang.System.loadLibrary()</code>
        </p>
      </attribute>
      <attribute name="libraryPath" required="false">
        <p>The absolute path of the native library, as defined in
        <code>java.lang.System.load()</code>
        </p>
      </attribute>
    </attributes>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="JRE Memory Leak Prevention Listener - org.apache.catalina.core.JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener">

    <p>The <strong>JRE Memory Leak Prevention Listener</strong> provides
    work-arounds for known places where the Java Runtime environment uses
    the context class loader to load a singleton as this will cause a memory
    leak if a web application class loader happens to be the context class
    loader at the time. The work-around is to initialise these singletons when
    this listener starts as Tomcat's common class loader is the context class
    loader at that time. It also provides work-arounds for known issues that
    can result in locked JAR files.</p>

    <p>This listener must only be nested within <a href="server.html">Server</a>
    elements.</p>

    <p>The following additional attributes are supported by the <strong>JRE
    Memory Leak Prevention Listener</strong>:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="appContextProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that calls to
        <code>sun.awt.AppContext.getAppContext()</code> triggered by a web
        application do not result in a memory leak. Note that enabling this
        protection will trigger a requirement for a graphical environment unless
        Java is started in head-less mode. The default is <code>false</code>.
        </p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="AWTThreadProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that calls to
        <code>java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit()</code> triggered by a web
        application do not result in a memory leak.
        Defaults to <code>false</code> because an AWT thread is launched. This
        protection is disabled if running on Java 9 onwards since the leak has
        been fixed for Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="classesToInitialize" required="false">
        <p>List of comma-separated fully qualified class names to load and initialize
        during the startup of this Listener. This allows to pre-load classes that are
        known to provoke classloader leaks if they are loaded during a request
        processing. Non-JRE classes may be referenced, like
        <code>oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleTimeoutThreadPerVM</code>.
        The default value is empty, but specific JRE classes are loaded by other leak
        protection features managed by other attributes of this Listener.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="driverManagerProtection" required="false">
        <p>The first use of <code>java.sql.DriverManager</code> will trigger the
        loading of JDBC Drivers visible to the current class loader and its
        parents. The web application level memory leak protection can take care
        of this in most cases but triggering the loading here has fewer
        side-effects. The default is <code>true</code>.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="forkJoinCommonPoolProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so the threads created for
        <code>ForkJoinPool.commonPool()</code> do not result in a memory leak.
        The protection is enabled by setting the
        <code>java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory</code>
        system property. If this property is set when Tomcat starts, Tomcat will
        not over-ride it even if this protection is explicitly enabled. The
        default is <code>true</code>.  This protection is disabled if running on
        Java 9 onwards since the leak has been fixed for Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="gcDaemonProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that calls to
        <code>sun.misc.GC.requestLatency(long)</code> triggered by a web
        application do not result in a memory leak. Use of RMI is likely to
        trigger a call to this method. A side effect of enabling this protection
        is the creation of a thread named "GC Daemon". The protection uses
        reflection to access internal Sun classes and may generate errors on
        startup on non-Sun JVMs. The default is <code>true</code>. This
        protection is disabled if running on Java 9 onwards since the leak has
        been fixed for Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="ldapPoolProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that the PoolCleaner thread started by
        <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapPoolManager</code> does not result in a
        memory leak. The thread is started the first time the
        <code>LdapPoolManager</code> class is used if the system property
        <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.pool.timeout</code> is set to a value
        greater than 0. Without this protection, if a web application uses this
        class the PoolCleaner thread will be configured with the thread's
        context class loader set to the web application class loader which in
        turn will trigger a memory leak on reload. Defaults to
        <code>true</code>. This protection is disabled if running on Java 9
        onwards since the leak has been fixed for Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="tokenPollerProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that any token poller thread initialized by
        <code>sun.security.pkcs11.SunPKCS11.initToken()</code> does not
        result in a memory leak. The thread is started depending on various
        conditions as part of the initialization of the Java Cryptography
        Architecture. Without the protection this can happen during Webapp
        deployment when the MessageDigest for generating session IDs is
        initialized. As a result the thread has the Webapp class loader as its
        thread context class loader. Enabling the protection initializes JCA
        early during Tomcat startup. Defaults to <code>true</code>. This
        protection is disabled if running on Java 9 onwards since the leak has
        been fixed for Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="urlCacheProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that reading resources from JAR files using
        <code>java.net.URLConnection</code>s does not result in the JAR file
        being locked. Note that enabling this protection disables caching by
        default for all resources obtained via
        <code>java.net.URLConnection</code>s. Caching may be re-enabled on a
        case by case basis as required. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="xmlParsingProtection" required="false">
        <p>Enables protection so that parsing XML files within a web application
        does not result in a memory leak. Note that memory profilers may not
        display the GC root associated with this leak making it particularly
        hard to diagnose. Defaults to <code>true</code>. This protection is
        disabled if running on Java 9 onwards since the leak has been fixed for
        Java 9 onwards.</p>
      </attribute>

    </attributes>

    <subsection name="JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener Examples">

      <p>The following is an example of how to configure the
      <code>classesToInitialize</code> attribute of this listener.</p>

      <p>If this listener was configured in server.xml as:</p>

      <source><![CDATA[  <Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.JreMemoryLeakPreventionListener"
            classesToInitialize="oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleTimeoutThreadPerVM" />]]></source>

      <p>then the <code>OracleTimeoutThreadPerVM</code> class would be loaded
      and initialized during listener startup instead of during request
      processing.</p>

    </subsection>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Security Lifecycle Listener - org.apache.catalina.security.SecurityListener">

    <p>The <strong>Security Lifecycle Listener</strong> performs a number of
    security checks when Tomcat starts and prevents Tomcat from starting if they
    fail. The listener is not enabled by default. To enabled it uncomment the
    listener in $CATALINA_BASE/conf/server.xml.</p>

    <p>This listener must only be nested within <a href="server.html">Server</a>
    elements.</p>

    <p>The following additional attributes are supported by the <strong>Security
    Lifecycle Listener</strong>:</p>

    <attributes>

      <attribute name="checkedOsUsers" required="false">
        <p>A comma separated list of OS users that must not be used to start
        Tomcat. If not specified, the default value of <b>root</b> is used. To
        disable this check, set the attribute to the empty string. Usernames
        are checked in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
      </attribute>

      <attribute name="minimumUmask" required="false">
        <p>The least restrictive umask that must be configured before Tomcat
        will start. If not specified, the default value of <b>0007</b> is used.

    <p>The <strong>StoreConfig Lifecycle Listener</strong> configures a
    StoreConfig MBean that may be used to save the current server configuration
    in server.xml or the current configuration for a web application in a
    context.xml file.</p>

    <p>This listener must only be nested within <a href="server.html">Server</a>
