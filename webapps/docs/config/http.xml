<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>HTTP Connector</strong> element represents a
  <strong>Connector</strong> component that supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
  It enables Catalina to function as a stand-alone web server, in addition
  to its ability to execute servlets and JSP pages.  A particular instance
  of this component listens for connections on a specific TCP port number
  on the server.  One or more such <strong>Connectors</strong> can be
  configured as part of a single <a href="service.html">Service</a>, each
  forwarding to the associated <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> to perform
  request processing and create the response.</p>

  <p>If you wish to configure the <strong>Connector</strong> that is used
  for connections to web servers using the AJP protocol (such as the
  <code>mod_jk 1.2.x</code> connector for Apache 1.3), see
  <a href="ajp.html">here</a> instead.</p>

  <p>At server startup time, this <strong>Connector</strong> will create a
  number of request processing threads (based on the value configured for
  the <code>minSpareThreads</code> attribute).  Each incoming request requires
  a thread for the duration of that request.  If more simultaneous requests
  are received than can be handled by the currently available request
  processing threads, additional threads will be created up to the
  configured maximum (the value of the <code>maxThreads</code> attribute).
  If still more simultaneous requests are received, they are stacked up
  inside the server socket created by the <strong>Connector</strong>, up to
  the configured maximum (the value of the <code>acceptCount</code>
  attribute.  Any further simultaneous requests will receive "connection
  refused" errors, until resources are available to process them.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

  <p>All implementations of <strong>Connector</strong>
  support the following attributes:</p>

  <attributes>
 
    <attribute name="allowTrace" required="false">
      <p>A boolean value which can be used to enable or disable the TRACE
      HTTP method. If not specified, this attribute is set to false.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="emptySessionPath" required="false">
      <p>If set to <code>true</code>, all paths for session cookies will be set
      to <code>/</code>. This can be useful for portlet specification implementations,
      but will greatly affect performance if many applications are accessed on a given
      server by the client.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="enableLookups" required="false">
      <p>Set to <code>true</code> if you want calls to
      <code>request.getRemoteHost()</code> to perform DNS lookups in
      order to return the actual host name of the remote client.  Set
      to <code>false</code> to skip the DNS lookup and return the IP
      address in String form instead (thereby improving performance).
      By default, DNS lookups are enabled.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxPostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be handled by
      the container FORM URL parameter parsing. The limit can be disabled by
      setting this attribute to a value less than or equal to 0.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to 2097152 (2 megabytes).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxSavePostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be saved/buffered by
      the container during FORM or CLIENT-CERT authentication. For both types
      of authentication, the POST will be saved/buffered before the user is
      authenticated. For CLIENT-CERT authentication, the POST is buffered for
      the duration of
 the SSL handshake and the buffer emptied when the request
      is processed. For FORM authentication the POST is
 saved whilst the user
      is re-directed to the login form and is retained until the user
      successfully authenticates or the session associated with the
      authentication request expires. The limit can be disabled by setting this
      attribute to -1. Setting the attribute to
 zero will disable the saving of
      POST data during authentication
. If not
 specified, this attribute is set
      to
 4096 (4 kilobytes).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="protocol" required="false">
      <p>This attribute value must be <code>HTTP/1.1</code> to use the HTTP
      handler, which is the default.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyName" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server name
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerName()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server port
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerPort()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="redirectPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is supporting non-SSL
      requests, and a request is received for which a matching
      <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> requires SSL transport,
      Catalina will automatically redirect the request to the port
      number specified here.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="scheme" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to the name of the protocol you wish to have
      returned by calls to <code>request.getScheme()</code>.  For
      example, you would set this attribute to "<code>https</code>"
      for an SSL Connector.  The default value is "<code>http</code>".
      See <a href="#SSL Support">SSL Support</a> for more information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="secure" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> if you wish to have
      calls to <code>request.isSecure()</code> to return <code>true</code>
      for requests received by this Connector (you would want this on an
      SSL Connector).  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="URIEncoding" required="false">
      <p>This specifies the character encoding used to decode the URI bytes,
      after %xx decoding the URL. If not specified, ISO-8859-1 will be used.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useBodyEncodingForURI" required="false">
      <p>This specifies if the encoding specified in contentType should be used
      for URI query parameters, instead of using the URIEncoding. This
      setting is present for compatibility with Tomcat 4.1.x, where the
      encoding specified in the contentType, or explicitely set using
      Request.setCharacterEncoding method was also used for the parameters from
      the URL. The default value is <code>false</code>.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useIPVHosts" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to use
      the IP address that the request was recieved on to determine the Host
      to send the request to.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="xpoweredBy" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to advertise
      support for the Servlet specification using the header recommended in the
      specification.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

  <p>
  HTTP supports the following additional attributes (in addition to the
  common attributes listed above):</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="acceptCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when
      all possible request processing threads are in use.  Any requests
      received when the queue is full will be refused.  The default
      value is 10.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="address" required="false">
      <p>For servers with more than one IP address, this attribute
      specifies which address will be used for listening on the specified
      port.  By default, this port will be used on all IP addresses
      associated with the server.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="bufferSize" required="false">
      <p>The size (in bytes) of the buffer to be provided for input
      streams created by this connector.  By default, buffers of
      2048 bytes will be provided.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compressableMimeType" required="false">
      <p>The value is a comma separated list of MIME types for which HTTP
      compression may be used.
      The default value is <code>text/html,text/xml,text/plain</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compression" required="false">
      <p>The <strong>Connector</strong> may use HTTP/1.1 GZIP compression in
      an attempt to save server bandwidth. The acceptable values for the
      parameter is "off" (disable compression), "on" (allow compression, which
      causes text data to be compressed), "force" (forces compression in all
      cases), or a numerical integer value (which is equivalent to "on", but
      specifies the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed). If
      the content-length is not known and compression is set to "on" or more
      aggressive, the output will also be compressed. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to "off".</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionLinger" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds during which the sockets used by this
      <strong>Connector</strong> will linger when they are closed.
      The default value is -1 (socket linger is disabled).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds this <strong>Connector</strong> will wait,
      after accepting a connection, for the request URI line to be
      presented.  The default value is 60000 (i.e. 60 seconds).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="disableUploadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>This flag allows the servlet container to use a different, longer
      connection timeout while a servlet is being executed, which in the end
      allows either the servlet a longer amount of time to complete its
      execution, or a longer timeout during data upload. If not specified,
      this attribute is set to "true".</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHttpHeaderSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size of the request and response HTTP header, specified
      in bytes.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to 4096 (4 KB).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxKeepAliveRequests" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of HTTP requests which can be pipelined until
      the connection is closed by the server. Setting this attribute to 1 will
      disable HTTP/1.0 keep-alive, as well as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and
      pipelining. Setting this to -1 will allow an unlimited amount of
      pipelined or keep-alive HTTP requests.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to 100.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxSpareThreads" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of unused request processing threads that
      will be allowed to exist until the thread pool starts stopping the
      unnecessary threads.  The default value is 50.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxThreads" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of request processing threads to be created
      by this <strong>Connector</strong>, which therefore determines the
      maximum number of simultaneous requests that can be handled.  If
      not specified, this attribute is set to 200.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="minSpareThreads" required="false">
      <p>The number of request processing threads that will be created
      when this <strong>Connector</strong> is first started.  The connector
      will also make sure it has the specified number of idle processing
      threads available. This attribute should be set to a value smaller
      than that set for <code>maxThreads</code>.  The default value is 4.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="noCompressionUserAgents" required="false">
      <p>The value is a comma separated list of regular expressions matching
      user-agents of HTTP clients for which compression should not be used,
      because these clients, although they do advertise support for the
      feature, have a broken implementation.
      The default value is an empty String (regexp matching disabled).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="port" required="true">
      <p>The TCP port number on which this <strong>Connector</strong>
      will create a server socket and await incoming connections.  Your
      operating system will allow only one server application to listen
      to a particular port number on a particular IP address.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="restrictedUserAgents" required="false">
      <p>The value is a comma separated list of regular expressions matching
      user-agents of HTTP clients for which HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0 keep alive
      should not be used, even if the clients advertise support for these
      features.
      The default value is an empty String (regexp matching disabled).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="server" required="false">
      <p>The Server header for the http response.
         Unless your paranoid, you won't need this feature.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="socketBuffer" required="false">
      <p>The size (in bytes) of the buffer to be provided for socket
      output buffering. -1 can be specified to disable the use of a buffer.
      By default, a buffers of 9000 bytes will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="strategy" required="false">
      <p>The thread pooling strategy which will be used. The default strategy does 
      not use a master thread, but a more conventional strategy using a 
      master listener thread can be used by setting "ms" as this attribute's value. 
      The master strategy will work significantly better using the threadPriority 
      attribute, which will apply only to the thread which listens on the server socket.
      This is set to <code>lf</code> by default.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="tcpNoDelay" required="false">
      <p>If set to <code>true</code>, the TCP_NO_DELAY option will be
      set on the server socket, which improves performance under most
      circumstances.  This is set to <code>true</code> by default.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="threadPriority" required="false">
      <p>The priority of the request processing threads within the JVM.
      The default value is <code>java.lang.Thread#NORM_PRIORITY</code>.
      See the JavaDoc for the java.lang.Thread class for more details on
      what this priority means.

<section name="Special Features">


  <subsection name="HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 Support">

  <p>This <strong>Connector</strong> supports all of the required features
  of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, as described in RFC 2616, including persistent
  connections, pipelining, expectations and chunked encoding.  If the client
  (typically a browser) supports only HTTP/1.0, the
  <strong>Connector</strong> will gracefully fall back to supporting this
  protocol as well.  No special configuration is required to enable this
  support. The <strong>Connector</strong> also supports HTTP/1.0
  keep-alive.</p>

  <p>RFC 2616 requires that HTTP servers always begin their responses with
  the highest HTTP version that they claim to support.  Therefore, this
  <strong>Connector</strong> will always return <code>HTTP/1.1</code> at
  the beginning of its responses.</p>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="Proxy Support">

  <p>The <code>proxyName</code> and <code>proxyPort</code> attributes can
  be used when Tomcat is run behind a proxy server.  These attributes
  modify the values returned to web applications that call the
  <code>request.getServerName()</code> and <code>request.getServerPort()</code>
  methods, which are often used to construct absolute URLs for redirects.
  Without configuring these attributes, the values returned would reflect
  the server name and port on which the connection from the proxy server
  was received, rather than the server name and port to whom the client
  directed the original request.</p>

  <p>For more information, see the
  <a href="../proxy-howto.html">Proxy Support HOW-TO</a>.</p>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="SSL Support">

  <p>You can enable SSL support for a particular instance of this
  <strong>Connector</strong> by setting the <code>secure</code> attribute to
  <code>true</code>.  In addition, you may need to configure the following
  attributes:</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="algorithm" required="false">
      <p>The certificate encoding algorithm to be used.  If not
      specified, the default value is <code>SunX509</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="clientAuth" required="false">
      <p>Set to <code>true</code> if you want the SSL stack to require a
      valid certificate chain from the client before
 accepting a connection.
      Set to <code>want</code> if you
 want the SSL stack to request a client
      Certificate, but
 not fail if one isn't presented. A <code>false</code>
      value (which is the default) will not require a certificate chain
      unless
 the client requests a resource protected by a security
      constraint
 that uses <code>CLIENT-CERT</code> authentication. See the
      <a href="../ssl-howto.html">SSL HowTo</a> for an example.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keystoreFile" required="false">
      <p>The pathname of the keystore file where you have stored the
      server certificate to be loaded.  By default, the pathname is
      the file "<code>.keystore</code>" in the operating system home
      directory of the user that is running Tomcat.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keystorePass" required="false">
      <p>The password used to access the server certificate from the
      specified keystore file.  The default value is "<code>changeit</code>".
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keystoreType" required="false">
      <p>The type of keystore file to be used for the server certificate.
      If not specified, the default value is "<code>JKS</code>".</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="sslProtocol" required="false">
      <p>The version of the SSL protocol to use.  If not specified,
      the default is "<code>TLS</code>".</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="ciphers" required="false">
      <p>A comma seperated list of the encryption ciphers that may be used.
      If not specified, then any available cipher may be used.</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>
