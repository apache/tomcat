<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>HTTP Connector</strong> element represents a
  <strong>Connector</strong> component that supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
  It enables Catalina to function as a stand-alone web server, in addition
  to its ability to execute servlets and JSP pages.  A particular instance
  of this component listens for connections on a specific TCP port number
  on the server.  One or more such <strong>Connectors</strong> can be
  configured as part of a single <a href="service.html">Service</a>, each
  forwarding to the associated <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> to perform
  request processing and create the response.</p>

  <p>If you wish to configure the <strong>Connector</strong> that is used
  for connections to web servers using the AJP protocol (such as the
  <code>mod_jk 1.2.x</code> connector for Apache 1.3), please refer to the
  <a href="ajp.html">AJP Connector</a> documentation.</p>

  <p>Each incoming, non-asynchronous request requires a thread for the duration
  of that request.  If more simultaneous requests are received than can be
  handled by the currently available request processing threads, additional
  threads will be created up to the configured maximum (the value of the
  <code>maxThreads</code> attribute). If still more simultaneous requests are
  received, Tomcat will accept new connections until the current number of
  connections reaches <code>maxConnections</code>. Connections are queued inside
  the server socket created by the <strong>Connector</strong> until a thread
  becomes available to process the connection. Once <code>maxConnections</code>
  has been reached the operating system will queue further connections. The size
  of the  operating system provided connection queue may be controlled by the
  <code>acceptCount</code> attribute. If the operating system queue fills,
  further connection requests may be refused or may time out.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

  <p>All implementations of <strong>Connector</strong>
  support the following attributes:</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="allowBackslash" required="false">
      <p>If this is <code>true</code> the '\' character will be permitted as a
      path delimiter.</p>
      <p>If not specified, the default value of <code>false</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="allowTrace" required="false">
      <p>A boolean value which can be used to enable or disable the TRACE
      HTTP method. If not specified, this attribute is set to false. As per RFC
      7231 section 4.3.8, cookie and authorization headers will be excluded from
      the response to the TRACE request. If you wish to include these, you can
      implement the <code>doTrace()</code> method for the target Servlet and
      gain full control over the response.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="asyncTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The default timeout for asynchronous requests in milliseconds. If not
      specified, this attribute is set to the Servlet specification default of
      30000 (30 seconds).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="discardFacades" required="false">
      <p>A boolean value which can be used to enable or disable the recycling
      of the facade objects that isolate the container internal request
      processing objects. If set to <code>true</code> the facades will be
      set for garbage collection after every request, otherwise they will be
      reused. If not specified, this attribute is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="enableLookups" required="false">
      <p>Set to <code>true</code> if you want calls to
      <code>request.getRemoteHost()</code> to perform DNS lookups in
      order to return the actual host name of the remote client.  Set
      to <code>false</code> to skip the DNS lookup and return the IP
      address in String form instead (thereby improving performance).
      By default, DNS lookups are disabled.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="encodedSolidusHandling" required="false">
      <p>When set to <code>reject</code> request paths containing a
      <code>%2f</code> sequence will be rejected with a 400 response. When set
      to <code>decode</code> request paths containing a <code>%2f</code>
      sequence will have that sequence decoded to <code>/</code> at the same
      time other <code>%nn</code> sequences are decoded. When set to
      <code>passthrough</code> request paths containing a <code>%2f</code>
      sequence will be processed with the <code>%2f</code> sequence unchanged.
      If not specified the default value is <code>reject</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="enforceEncodingInGetWriter" required="false">
      <p>If this is <code>true</code> then
      a call to <code>Response.getWriter()</code> if no character encoding
      has been specified will result in subsequent calls to
      <code>Response.getCharacterEncoding()</code> returning
      <code>ISO-8859-1</code> and the <code>Content-Type</code> response header
      will include a <code>charset=ISO-8859-1</code> component. (SRV.15.2.22.1)</p>
      <p>If not specified, the default specification compliant value of
      <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxCookieCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of cookies that are permitted for a request. A value
      of less than zero means no limit. If not specified, a default value of 200
      will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxParameterCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum total number of request parameters (including uploaded
      files) obtained from the query string and, for POST requests, the request
      body if the content type is
      <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or
      <code>multipart/form-data</code>. Requests that exceed this limit will be
      rejected. A value of less than 0 means no limit. If not specified, a
      default of 1000 is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxPostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be handled by
      the container FORM URL parameter parsing. The limit can be disabled by
      setting this attribute to a value less than zero. Requests that exceed
      this limit will be rejected. If not specified, this attribute is set to
      2097152 (2 MiB).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxSavePostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the request body which will be
      saved/buffered by the container during FORM or CLIENT-CERT authentication
      or during HTTP/1.1 upgrade. For both types of authentication, the request
      body will be saved/buffered before the user is authenticated. For
      CLIENT-CERT authentication, the request body is buffered for the duration
      of the SSL handshake and the buffer emptied when the request is processed.
      For FORM authentication the POST is saved whilst the user is re-directed
      to the login form and is retained until the user successfully
      authenticates or the session associated with the authentication request
      expires. For HTTP/1.1 upgrade, the request body is buffered for the
      duration of the upgrade process. The limit can be disabled by setting this
      attribute to -1. Setting the attribute to zero will disable the saving of
      the request body data during authentication and HTTP/1.1 upgrade. If not
      specified, this attribute is set to 4096 (4 kilobytes).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="parseBodyMethods" required="false">
      <p>A comma-separated list of HTTP methods for which request
      bodies using <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> will be parsed
      for request parameters identically to POST. This is useful in RESTful
      applications that want to support POST-style semantics for PUT requests.
      Note that any setting other than <code>POST</code> causes Tomcat
      to behave in a way that goes against the intent of the servlet
      specification.
      The HTTP method TRACE is specifically forbidden here in accordance
      with the HTTP specification.
      The default is <code>POST</code></p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="port" required="true">
      <p>The TCP port number on which this <strong>Connector</strong>
      will create a server socket and await incoming connections.  Your
      operating system will allow only one server application to listen
      to a particular port number on a particular IP address. If the special
      value of 0 (zero) is used, then Tomcat will select a free port at random
      to use for this connector. This is typically only useful in embedded and
      testing applications.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="protocol" required="false">
      <p>Sets the protocol to handle incoming traffic. The default value is
        <code>HTTP/1.1</code> which uses a Java NIO based connector.<br/>
        To use an explicit protocol, the following values may be used:<br/>
        <code>org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol</code> -
              non blocking Java NIO connector<br/>
        <code>org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Nio2Protocol</code> -
              non blocking Java NIO2 connector<br/>
        Custom implementations may also be used.<br/>
        Take a look at our <a href="#Connector_Comparison">Connector
        Comparison</a> chart. The configuration for Java connectors is
        identical, for http and https.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyName" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server name
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerName()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy_Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server port
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerPort()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy_Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="redirectPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is supporting non-SSL
      requests, and a request is received for which a matching
      <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> requires SSL transport,
      Catalina will automatically redirect the request to the port
      number specified here.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="rejectSuspiciousURIs" required="false">
      <p>Should this <strong>Connector</strong> reject a requests if the URI
      matches one of the suspicious URIs patterns identified by the Servlet 6.0
      specification? The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="scheme" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to the name of the protocol you wish to have
      returned by calls to <code>request.getScheme()</code>.  For
      example, you would set this attribute to "<code>https</code>"
      for an SSL Connector.  The default value is "<code>http</code>".
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="secure" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> if you wish to have
      calls to <code>request.isSecure()</code> to return <code>true</code>
      for requests received by this Connector. You would want this on an
      SSL Connector or a non SSL connector that is receiving data from a
      SSL accelerator, like a crypto card, an SSL appliance or even a webserver.
      The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="URIEncoding" required="false">
      <p>This specifies the character encoding used to decode the URI bytes,
      after %xx decoding the URL. The default value is <code>UTF-8</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useBodyEncodingForURI" required="false">
      <p>This specifies if the encoding specified in contentType should be used
      for URI query parameters, instead of using the URIEncoding. This
      setting is present for compatibility with Tomcat 4.1.x, where the
      encoding specified in the contentType, or explicitly set using
      Request.setCharacterEncoding method was also used for the parameters from
      the URL. The default value is <code>false</code>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> 1) This setting is applied only to the
      query string of a request. Unlike <code>URIEncoding</code> it does not
      affect the path portion of a request URI. 2) If request character
      encoding is not known (is not provided by a browser and is not set by
      <code>SetCharacterEncodingFilter</code> or a similar filter using
      Request.setCharacterEncoding method), the default encoding is always
      "ISO-8859-1". The <code>URIEncoding</code> setting has no effect on
      this default.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useIPVHosts" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to use
      the IP address that the request was received on to determine the Host
      to send the request to.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="xpoweredBy" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to advertise
      support for the Servlet specification using the header recommended in the
      specification.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

  <p>The standard HTTP connectors (NIO and NIO2) all support the following
  attributes in addition to the common Connector attributes listed above.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="acceptCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum length of the operating system provided queue for incoming
      connection requests when <code>maxConnections</code> has been reached. The
      operating system may ignore this setting and use a different size for the
      queue. When this queue is full, the operating system may actively refuse
      additional connections or those connections may time out. The default
      value is 100.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="acceptorThreadPriority" required="false">
      <p>The priority of the acceptor thread. The thread used to accept
      new connections. The default value is <code>5</code> (the value of the
      <code>java.lang.Thread.NORM_PRIORITY</code> constant). See the JavaDoc
      for the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> class for more details on what
      this priority means.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="address" required="false">
      <p>For servers with more than one IP address, this attribute specifies
      which address will be used for listening on the specified port. By
      default, the connector will listen all local addresses. Unless the JVM is
      configured otherwise using system properties, the Java based connectors
      (NIO, NIO2) will listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses when configured
      with either <code>0.0.0.0</code> or <code>::</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="allowedTrailerHeaders" required="false">
      <p>By default Tomcat will ignore all trailer headers when processing
      chunked input. For a header to be processed, it must be added to this
      comma-separated list of header names.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="bindOnInit" required="false">
      <p>Controls when the socket used by the connector is bound. If set to
      <code>true</code> it is bound when the connector is initiated and unbound
      when the connector is destroyed. If set to <code>false</code>, the socket
      will be bound when the connector is started and unbound when it is
      stopped. If not specified, the default is <code>true</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="clientCertProvider" required="false">
      <p>When client certificate information is presented in a form other than
      instances of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code> it needs to
      be converted before it can be used and this property controls which JSSE
      provider is used to perform the conversion.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compressibleMimeType" required="false">
      <p>The value is a comma separated list of MIME types for which HTTP
      compression may be used.
      The default value is
      <code>
      text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript,application/json,application/xml
      </code>.
      If you specify a type explicitly, the default is over-ridden.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compression" required="false">
      <p>The <strong>Connector</strong> may use HTTP/1.1 GZIP compression in
      an attempt to save server bandwidth. The acceptable values for the
      parameter is "off" (disable compression), "on" (allow compression, which
      causes text data to be compressed), "force" (forces compression in all
      cases), or a numerical integer value (which is equivalent to "on", but
      specifies the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed). If
      the content-length is not known and compression is set to "on" or more
      aggressive, the output will also be compressed. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to "off".</p>
      <p><em>Note</em>: There is a tradeoff between using compression (saving
      your bandwidth) and using the sendfile feature (saving your CPU cycles).
      If the connector supports the sendfile feature, e.g. the NIO connector,
      using sendfile will take precedence over compression. The symptoms will
      be that static files greater that 48 KiB will be sent uncompressed.
      You can turn off sendfile by setting <code>useSendfile</code> attribute
      of the connector, as documented below, or change the sendfile usage
      threshold in the configuration of the
      <a href="../default-servlet.html">DefaultServlet</a> in the default
      <code>conf/web.xml</code> or in the <code>web.xml</code> of your web
      application.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compressionMinSize" required="false">
      <p>If <strong>compression</strong> is set to "on" then this attribute
      may be used to specify the minimum amount of data before the output is
      compressed. If not specified, this attribute is defaults to "2048".
      Units are in bytes.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionLinger" required="false">
      <p>The number of seconds during which the sockets used by this
      <strong>Connector</strong> will linger when they are closed. The default
      value is <code>-1</code> which disables socket linger.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds this <strong>Connector</strong> will wait,
      after accepting a connection, for the request URI line to be
      presented. Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.
      The default value is 60000 (i.e. 60 seconds) but note that the standard
      server.xml that ships with Tomcat sets this to 20000 (i.e. 20 seconds).
      Unless <strong>disableUploadTimeout</strong> is set to <code>false</code>,
      this timeout will also be used when reading the request body (if any).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionUploadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>Specifies the timeout, in milliseconds, to use while a data upload is
      in progress. This only takes effect if
      <strong>disableUploadTimeout</strong> is set to <code>false</code>.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="continueResponseTiming" required="false">
      <p>When to respond with a <code>100</code> intermediate response code to a
      request containing an <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> header.
      The following values may used:
      <ul>
      <li><code>immediately</code> - an intermediate 100 status response
      will be returned as soon as practical</li>
      <li><code>onRead</code> - an intermediate 100 status
      response will be returned only when the Servlet reads the request body,
      allowing the servlet to inspect the headers and possibly respond
      before the user agent sends a possibly large request body.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="defaultSSLHostConfigName" required="false">
      <p>The name of the default <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> that will be
      used for secure connections (if this connector is configured for secure
      connections) if the client connection does not provide SNI or if the SNI
      is provided but does not match any configured
      <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. If not specified the default value of
      <code>_default_</code> will be used. Provided values are always converted
      to lower case.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="disableUploadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>This flag allows the servlet container to use a different, usually
      longer connection timeout during data upload. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to <code>true</code> which disables this longer timeout.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="executor" required="false">
      <p>A reference to the name in an <a href="executor.html">Executor</a>
      element. If this attribute is set, and the named executor exists, the
      connector will use the executor, and all the other thread attributes will
      be ignored. Note that if a shared executor is not specified for a
      connector then the connector will use a private, internal executor to
      provide the thread pool.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="executorTerminationTimeoutMillis" required="false">
      <p>The time that the private internal executor will wait for request
      processing threads to terminate before continuing with the process of
      stopping the connector. If not set, the default is  <code>5000</code> (5
      seconds).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keepAliveTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds this <strong>Connector</strong> will wait
      for another HTTP request before closing the connection. The default value
      is to use the value that has been set for the
      <strong>connectionTimeout</strong> attribute.
      Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxConnections" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of connections that the server will accept and
      process at any given time. When this number has been reached, the server
      will accept, but not process, one further connection. This additional
      connection be blocked until the number of connections being processed
      falls below <strong>maxConnections</strong> at which point the server will
      start accepting and processing new connections again. Note that once the
      limit has been reached, the operating system may still accept connections
      based on the <code>acceptCount</code> setting. The default value
      is <code>8192</code>.</p>
      <p>For NIO/NIO2 only, setting the value to -1, will disable the
      maxConnections feature and connections will not be counted.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxExtensionSize" required="false">
      <p>Limits the total length of chunk extensions in chunked HTTP requests.
      If the value is <code>-1</code>, no limit will be imposed. If not
      specified, the default value of <code>8192</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHeaderCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of headers in a request that are allowed by the
      container. A request that contains more headers than the specified limit
      will be rejected. A value of less than 0 means no limit.
      If not specified, a default of 100 is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHttpHeaderSize" required="false">
      <p>Provides the default value for
      <strong>maxHttpRequestHeaderSize</strong> and
      <strong>maxHttpResponseHeaderSize</strong>. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to 8192 (8 KiB).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHttpRequestHeaderSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum permitted size of the request line and headers associated
      with an HTTP request, specified in bytes. This is compared to the number
      of bytes received so includes line terminators and whitespace as well as
      the request line, header names and header values. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to the value of the <code>maxHttpHeaderSize</code>
      attribute.</p>
      <p>If you see "Request header is too large" errors you can increase this,
      but be aware that Tomcat will allocate the full amount you specify for
      every request. For example, if you specify a maxHttpRequestHeaderSize of
      1 MB and your application handles 100 concurrent requests, you will see

<section name="Nested Components">

  <p>Tomcat supports Server Name Indication (SNI). This allows multiple SSL
  configurations to be associated with a single secure connector with the
  configuration used for any given connection determined by the host name
  requested by the client. To facilitate this, the
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> element was added which can be used to define
  one of these configurations. Any number of <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> may
  be nested in a <strong>Connector</strong>. At the same time, support was added
  for multiple certificates to be associated with a single
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. Each SSL certificate is therefore configured
  in a <strong>Certificate</strong> element within an
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. For further information, see the SSL Support
  section below.</p>

  <p>When OpenSSL is providing the TLS implementation, one or more
  <strong>OpenSSLConfCmd</strong> elements may be nested inside a
  <strong>OpenSSLConf</strong> element to configure OpenSSL via OpenSSL's
  <code>SSL_CONF</code> API. A single <strong>OpenSSLConf</strong> element may
  be nested in a <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> element. For further
  information, see the SSL Support section below</p>

</section>


<section name="Special Features">


  <subsection name="HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 Support">

  <p>This <strong>Connector</strong> supports all of the required features
  of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, as described in RFCs 7230-7235, including persistent
  connections, pipelining, expectations and chunked encoding.  If the client
  supports only HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/0.9, the
  <strong>Connector</strong> will gracefully fall back to supporting this
  protocol as well.  No special configuration is required to enable this
  support. The <strong>Connector</strong> also supports HTTP/1.0
  keep-alive.</p>

  <p>RFC 7230 requires that HTTP servers always begin their responses with
  the highest HTTP version that they claim to support.  Therefore, this
  <strong>Connector</strong> will always return <code>HTTP/1.1</code> at
  the beginning of its responses.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="HTTP/2 Support">

  <p>HTTP/2 support is provided for TLS (h2), non-TLS via HTTP upgrade (h2c)
     and direct HTTP/2 (h2c) connections. To enable HTTP/2 support for an HTTP
     connector the following <strong>UpgradeProtocol</strong> element must be
     nested within the <strong>Connector</strong> with a
     <strong>className</strong> attribute of
     <code>org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol</code>.</p>

<source><![CDATA[<Connector ... >
  <UpgradeProtocol className="org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol" />
</Connector>]]></source>

  <p>Additional configuration attributes are available. See the
  <a href="http2.html">HTTP/2 Upgrade Protocol</a> documentation for details.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Proxy Support">

  <p>The <code>proxyName</code> and <code>proxyPort</code> attributes can
  be used when Tomcat is run behind a proxy server.  These attributes
  modify the values returned to web applications that call the
  <code>request.getServerName()</code> and <code>request.getServerPort()</code>
  methods, which are often used to construct absolute URLs for redirects.
  Without configuring these attributes, the values returned would reflect
  the server name and port on which the connection from the proxy server
  was received, rather than the server name and port to whom the client
  directed the original request.</p>

  <p>For more information, see the
  <a href="../proxy-howto.html">Proxy Support How-To</a>.</p>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="Unix Domain Socket Support">

  <p>When the <code>unixDomainSocketPath</code> attribute is used, connectors
  that support Unix Domain Sockets will bind to the socket at the given path.
  </p>

  <p>For users of Java 16 and higher, support is provided within the NIO
  connectors.
  </p>

  <p>The socket path is created with read and write permissions for all
  users. To protect this socket, place it in a directory with suitable
  permissions appropriately configured to restrict access as required.
  Alternatively, on platforms that support posix permissions, the
  permissions on the socket can be set directly with the
  <code>unixDomainSocketPathPermissions</code> option.
  </p>

  <p>Tomcat will automatically remove the socket on server shutdown. If the
  socket already exists startup will fail. Care must be taken by the
  administrator to remove the socket after verifying that the socket isn't
  already being used by an existing Tomcat process.</p>

  <p>The Unix Domain Socket can be accessed using the
  <code>--unix-socket</code> option of the <code>curl</code> command line
  client, and the Unix Domain Socket support in Apache HTTP server's
  <code>mod_proxy</code> module.
  </p>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="SSL Support">

  <p>You can enable SSL support for a particular instance of this
  <strong>Connector</strong> by setting the <code>SSLEnabled</code> attribute to
  <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>You will also need to set the <code>scheme</code> and <code>secure</code>
  attributes to the values <code>https</code> and <code>true</code>
  respectively, to pass correct information to the servlets.</p>

  <p>The NIO and NIO2 connectors use either the JSSE Java SSL implementation or
  an OpenSSL implementation. As far as possible, common configuration attributes
  are used for both JSSE and OpenSSL.</p>

  <p>Each secure connector must define at least one
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. The names of the
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> elements must be unique and one of them must
  match the <code>defaultSSLHostConfigName</code> attribute of the
  <strong>Connector</strong>.</p>

  <p>Each <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> must in turn define at least one
  <strong>Certificate</strong>. The types of the <strong>Certificate</strong>s
  must be unique.</p>

  <p>In addition to the standard TLS related request attributes defined in
  section 3.10 of the Servlet specification, Tomcat supports a number of
  additional TLS related attributes. The full list may be found in the <a
  href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-11.0-doc/api/index.html">SSLSupport
  Javadoc</a>.</p>

      parameter.  Relative paths will be resolved against
      <code>$CATALINA_BASE</code>.  A URI may also be used for this attribute.
      When using a domain keystore (<code>keystoreType</code> of
      <code>DKS</code>), this parameter should be the URI to the domain
      keystore.</p>

    <attribute name="certificateKeystorePassword" required="false">
      <p>JSSE only.</p>
      <p>The password to use to access the keystore containing the server&apos;s

      <p>The name of the keystore provider to be used for the server
      certificate. If not specified, the value of the system property
      <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStoreProvider</code> is used. If neither this

    <attribute name="certificateKeystoreType" required="false">

      <p>The type of keystore file to be used for the server certificate.
      If not specified, the value of the system property
      <code>javax.net.ssl.keyStoreType</code> is used. If neither this attribute
      nor the system property are set, a default value of "<code>JKS</code>". is
      used. See the notes on <a href="#Key_store_types">key store types</a>

  <subsection name="SSL Support - Connector - NIO and NIO2">

  <p>When APR/native is enabled, the connectors will default to using
  OpenSSL through JSSE, which may be more optimized than the JSSE Java
  implementation depending on the processor being used,
  and can be complemented with many commercial accelerator components.</p>

  <p>When OpenSSL FFM support is enabled, the connectors will default to using
  OpenSSL through JSSE, which is equivalent but uses the Java FFM API from
  Java 22 to access OpenSSL.</p>

  <p>The following NIO and NIO2 SSL configuration attributes are not specific to
  a virtual host and, therefore, must be configured on the connector.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="sniParseLimit" required="false">
      <p>In order to implement SNI support, Tomcat has to parse the first TLS
      message received on a new TLS connection (the client hello) to extract the
      requested server name. The message needs to be buffered so it can then be
      passed to the JSSE implementation for normal TLS processing. In theory,
      this first message could be very large although in practice it is
      typically a few hundred bytes. This attribute sets the maximum message
      size that Tomcat will buffer. If a message exceeds this size, the
      connection will be configured as if no server name was indicated by the
      client. If not specified a default of <code>65536</code> (64k) will be
      used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="sslImplementationName" required="false">
      <p>The class name of the SSL implementation to use. If not specified and
      the tomcat-native library is not installed, the
      default of <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.net.jsse.JSSEImplementation</code>
      will be used which wraps JVM&apos;s default JSSE provider. Note that the
      JVM can be configured to use a different JSSE provider as the default.
      Tomcat also bundles a special SSL implementation for JSSE that is backed
      by OpenSSL. To enable it, the native library should be enabled and Tomcat
      will automatically enable it and the default value of this attribute
      becomes
      <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.net.openssl.OpenSSLImplementation</code>.
      The FFM API from Java 22 may also be used to enable OpenSSL support, in
      which case the default value of the attribute becomes
      <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.net.openssl.panama.OpenSSLImplementation</code>.
      In that case, the attributes from either JSSE and OpenSSL
      configuration styles can be used, as long as the two types are not mixed
      (for example, it is not allowed to define use of a Java keystore and
      specify a separate pem private key using the OpenSSL attribute).</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="SSL Support - OpenSSL's SSL_CONF API">

  <p>When OpenSSL is providing the TLS implementation, one or more
  <strong>OpenSSLConfCmd</strong> elements may be nested inside a
  <strong>OpenSSLConf</strong> element to configure OpenSSL via OpenSSL's
  <code>SSL_CONF</code> API. A single <strong>OpenSSLConf</strong> element may
  be nested in a <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> element.</p>

  <p>The set of configuration file commands available depends on the OpenSSL
  version being used. For a list of supported command names and values, see the
  section Supported configuration file commands in the <a
  href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_CONF_cmd.html#SUPPORTED-CONFIGURATION-FILE-COMMANDS"
  >SSL_CONF_cmd(3)</a> manual page for OpenSSL. Some of the configuration file
  commands can be used as alternatives to <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>
  attributes. It is recommended that configuration file commands are only used
  where the feature cannot be configured using <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>
  attributes.</p>

  <p>The <strong>OpenSSLConf</strong> element does not support any
  attributes.</p>

  <p>The <strong>OpenSSLConfCmd</strong> element supports the following
  attributes.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="name" required="true">
      <p>The name of the configuration file command.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="value" required="false">
      <p>The value to use for the configuration file command.</p>
    </attribute>

  <subsection name="Key store types">

    <p>In addition to the standard key store types (JKS and PKCS12), most Java
    runtimes support additional key store types such as Windows-ROOT,
    Windows-My, DKS as well as hardware security modules. Generally, to use
    these additional keystore types with a TLS Connector in Tomcat:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set the certificateKeystoreType and/or truststoreType Connector
          attribute (as appropriate) to the necessary type</li>
      <li>If a configuration file is required, set the certificateKeystoreFile
          and/or truststoreFile Connector attribute (as appropriate) to point to
          the file</li>
      <li>If no configuration file is required then you will almost certainly
          need to explicitly set the certificateKeystoreFile and/or
          truststoreFile Connector attribute (as appropriate) to the empty
          string ("")</li>
      <li>If a password is required, set the certificateKeystorePassword and/or
          truststorePassword Connector attribute (as appropriate) to the
          required password</li>
      <li>If no password is required then you will almost certainly need to
          explicitly set the certificateKeystorePassword and/or
          truststorePassword Connector attribute (as appropriate) to the empty
          string ("")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Variations in key store implementations, combined with the key store
    manipulation Tomcat does in the background to allow interoperability between
    JSSE and OpenSSL configuration styles, means that some keystores may need
    slightly different configuration. Assistance is always available from the
    <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-users">Apache Tomcat
    users mailing list</a>. We aim to document any key stores that vary from the
    above advice here. Currently there are none we are aware of.</p>
