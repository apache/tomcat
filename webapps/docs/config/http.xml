<section name="Introduction">

  <p>The <strong>HTTP Connector</strong> element represents a
  <strong>Connector</strong> component that supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
  It enables Catalina to function as a stand-alone web server, in addition
  to its ability to execute servlets and JSP pages.  A particular instance
  of this component listens for connections on a specific TCP port number
  on the server.  One or more such <strong>Connectors</strong> can be
  configured as part of a single <a href="service.html">Service</a>, each
  forwarding to the associated <a href="engine.html">Engine</a> to perform
  request processing and create the response.</p>

  <p>If you wish to configure the <strong>Connector</strong> that is used
  for connections to web servers using the AJP protocol (such as the
  <code>mod_jk 1.2.x</code> connector for Apache 1.3), please refer to the
  <a href="ajp.html">AJP Connector</a> documentation.</p>

  <p>Each incoming request requires
  a thread for the duration of that request.  If more simultaneous requests
  are received than can be handled by the currently available request
  processing threads, additional threads will be created up to the
  configured maximum (the value of the <code>maxThreads</code> attribute).
  If still more simultaneous requests are received, they are stacked up
  inside the server socket created by the <strong>Connector</strong>, up to
  the configured maximum (the value of the <code>acceptCount</code>
  attribute).  Any further simultaneous requests will receive "connection
  refused" errors, until resources are available to process them.</p>

<section name="Attributes">

  <subsection name="Common Attributes">

  <p>All implementations of <strong>Connector</strong>
  support the following attributes:</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="allowTrace" required="false">
      <p>A boolean value which can be used to enable or disable the TRACE
      HTTP method. If not specified, this attribute is set to false.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="asyncTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The default timeout for asynchronous requests in milliseconds. If not
      specified, this attribute is set to the Servlet specification default of
      30000 (30 seconds).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="defaultSSLHostConfigName" required="false">
      <p>The name of the default <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> that will be
      used for secure connections (if this connector is configured for secure
      connections) if the client connection does not provide SNI or if the SNI
      is provided but does not match any configured
      <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. If not specified the default value of
      <code>_default_</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="enableLookups" required="false">
      <p>Set to <code>true</code> if you want calls to
      <code>request.getRemoteHost()</code> to perform DNS lookups in
      order to return the actual host name of the remote client.  Set
      to <code>false</code> to skip the DNS lookup and return the IP
      address in String form instead (thereby improving performance).
      By default, DNS lookups are disabled.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHeaderCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of headers in a request that are allowed by the
      container. A request that contains more headers than the specified limit
      will be rejected. A value of less than 0 means no limit.
      If not specified, a default of 100 is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxParameterCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of parameter and value pairs (GET plus POST) which
      will be automatically parsed by the container. Parameter and value pairs
      beyond this limit will be ignored. A value of less than 0 means no limit.
      If not specified, a default of 10000 is used. Note that
      <code>FailedRequestFilter</code> <a href="filter.html">filter</a> can be
      used to reject requests that hit the limit.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxPostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be handled by
      the container FORM URL parameter parsing. The limit can be disabled by
      setting this attribute to a value less than zero. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to 2097152 (2 megabytes). Note that the
      <a href="filter.html#Failed_Request_Filter"><code>FailedRequestFilter</code></a>
      can be used to reject requests that exceed this limit.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxSavePostSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size in bytes of the POST which will be saved/buffered by
      the container during FORM or CLIENT-CERT authentication. For both types
      of authentication, the POST will be saved/buffered before the user is
      authenticated. For CLIENT-CERT authentication, the POST is buffered for
      the duration of the SSL handshake and the buffer emptied when the request
      is processed. For FORM authentication the POST is saved whilst the user
      is re-directed to the login form and is retained until the user
      successfully authenticates or the session associated with the
      authentication request expires. The limit can be disabled by setting this
      attribute to -1. Setting the attribute to zero will disable the saving of
      POST data during authentication. If not specified, this attribute is set
      to 4096 (4 kilobytes).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="parseBodyMethods" required="false">
      <p>A comma-separated list of HTTP methods for which request
      bodies will be parsed for request parameters identically
      to POST. This is useful in RESTful applications that want to
      support POST-style semantics for PUT requests.
      Note that any setting other than <code>POST</code> causes Tomcat
      to behave in a way that goes against the intent of the servlet
      specification.
      The HTTP method TRACE is specifically forbidden here in accordance
      with the HTTP specification.
      The default is <code>POST</code></p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="port" required="true">
      <p>The TCP port number on which this <strong>Connector</strong>
      will create a server socket and await incoming connections.  Your
      operating system will allow only one server application to listen
      to a particular port number on a particular IP address. If the special
      value of 0 (zero) is used, then Tomcat will select a free port at random
      to use for this connector. This is typically only useful in embedded and
      testing applications.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="protocol" required="false">
      <p>Sets the protocol to handle incoming traffic. The default value is
        <code>HTTP/1.1</code> which uses an auto-switching mechanism to select
        either a Java NIO based connector or an APR/native based connector.
        If the <code>PATH</code> (Windows) or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (on
        most unix systems) environment variables contain the Tomcat native
        library, and the <code>AprLifecycleListener</code> that is used to
        initialize APR has its <code>useAprConnector</code> attribute set to
        <code>true</code>, the APR/native connector will be used. If the native library
        cannot be found or the attribute is not configured, the Java NIO based
        connector will be used. Note that the APR/native connector has different
        settings for HTTPS than the Java connectors.<br/>
        To use an explicit protocol rather than rely on the auto-switching
        mechanism described above, the following values may be used:<br/>
        <code>org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol</code> -
              non blocking Java NIO connector<br/>
        <code>org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Nio2Protocol</code> -
              non blocking Java NIO2 connector<br/>
        <code>org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol</code> -
              the APR/native connector.<br/>
        Custom implementations may also be used.<br/>
        Take a look at our <a href="#Connector_Comparison">Connector
        Comparison</a> chart. The configuration for both Java connectors is
        identical, for http and https.<br/>
        For more information on the APR connector and APR specific SSL settings
        please  visit the <a href="../apr.html">APR documentation</a>
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyName" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server name
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerName()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy_Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="proxyPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is being used in a proxy
      configuration, configure this attribute to specify the server port
      to be returned for calls to <code>request.getServerPort()</code>.
      See <a href="#Proxy_Support">Proxy Support</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="redirectPort" required="false">
      <p>If this <strong>Connector</strong> is supporting non-SSL
      requests, and a request is received for which a matching
      <code>&lt;security-constraint&gt;</code> requires SSL transport,
      Catalina will automatically redirect the request to the port
      number specified here.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="scheme" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to the name of the protocol you wish to have
      returned by calls to <code>request.getScheme()</code>.  For
      example, you would set this attribute to "<code>https</code>"
      for an SSL Connector.  The default value is "<code>http</code>".
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="secure" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> if you wish to have
      calls to <code>request.isSecure()</code> to return <code>true</code>
      for requests received by this Connector. You would want this on an
      SSL Connector or a non SSL connector that is receiving data from a
      SSL accelerator, like a crypto card, a SSL appliance or even a webserver.
      The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="URIEncoding" required="false">
      <p>This specifies the character encoding used to decode the URI bytes,
      after %xx decoding the URL. If not specified, UTF-8 will be used unless
      the <code>org.apache.catalina.STRICT_SERVLET_COMPLIANCE</code>
      <a href="systemprops.html">system property</a> is set to <code>true</code>
      in which case ISO-8859-1 will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useBodyEncodingForURI" required="false">
      <p>This specifies if the encoding specified in contentType should be used
      for URI query parameters, instead of using the URIEncoding. This
      setting is present for compatibility with Tomcat 4.1.x, where the
      encoding specified in the contentType, or explicitly set using
      Request.setCharacterEncoding method was also used for the parameters from
      the URL. The default value is <code>false</code>.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Notes:</strong> 1) This setting is applied only to the
      query string of a request. Unlike <code>URIEncoding</code> it does not
      affect the path portion of a request URI. 2) If request character
      encoding is not known (is not provided by a browser and is not set by
      <code>SetCharacterEncodingFilter</code> or a similar filter using
      Request.setCharacterEncoding method), the default encoding is always
      "ISO-8859-1". The <code>URIEncoding</code> setting has no effect on
      this default.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="useIPVHosts" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to use
      the IP address that the request was received on to determine the Host
      to send the request to.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="xpoweredBy" required="false">
      <p>Set this attribute to <code>true</code> to cause Tomcat to advertise
      support for the Servlet specification using the header recommended in the
      specification.  The default value is <code>false</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

  </attributes>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Standard Implementation">

  <p>The standard HTTP connectors (NIO, NIO2 and APR/native) all support the
  following attributes in addition to the common Connector attributes listed
  above.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="acceptCount" required="false">
      <p>The maximum queue length for incoming connection requests when
      all possible request processing threads are in use.  Any requests
      received when the queue is full will be refused.  The default
      value is 100.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="acceptorThreadCount" required="false">
      <p>The number of threads to be used to accept connections. Increase this
      value on a multi CPU machine, although you would never really need more
      than <code>2</code>. Also, with a lot of non keep alive connections, you
      might want to increase this value as well. Default value is
      <code>1</code>.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="acceptorThreadPriority" required="false">
      <p>The priority of the acceptor threads. The threads used to accept
      new connections. The default value is <code>5</code> (the value of the
      <code>java.lang.Thread.NORM_PRIORITY</code> constant). See the JavaDoc
      for the <code>java.lang.Thread</code> class for more details on what
      this priority means.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="address" required="false">
      <p>For servers with more than one IP address, this attribute
      specifies which address will be used for listening on the specified
      port.  By default, this port will be used on all IP addresses
      associated with the server.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="allowedTrailerHeaders" required="false">
      <p>By default Tomcat will ignore all trailer headers when processing
      chunked input. For a header to be processed, it must be added to this
      comma-separated list of header names.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="bindOnInit" required="false">
      <p>Controls when the socket used by the connector is bound. By default it
      is bound when the connector is initiated and unbound when the connector is
      destroyed. If set to <code>false</code>, the socket will be bound when the
      connector is started and unbound when it is stopped.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="clientCertProvider" required="false">
      <p>When client certificate information is presented in a form other than
      instances of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code> it needs to
      be converted before it can be used and this property controls which JSSE
      provider is used to perform the conversion. For example it is used with
      the <a href="ajp.html">AJP connectors</a>, the HTTP APR connector and
      with the <a href="valve.html#SSL_Authenticator_Valve">
      org.apache.catalina.valves.SSLValve</a>. If not specified, the default
      provider will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compressableMimeType" required="false">
      <p>The value is a comma separated list of MIME types for which HTTP
      compression may be used.
      The default value is
      <code>
      text/html,text/xml,text/plain,text/css,text/javascript,application/javascript
      </code>.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compression" required="false">
      <p>The <strong>Connector</strong> may use HTTP/1.1 GZIP compression in
      an attempt to save server bandwidth. The acceptable values for the
      parameter is "off" (disable compression), "on" (allow compression, which
      causes text data to be compressed), "force" (forces compression in all
      cases), or a numerical integer value (which is equivalent to "on", but
      specifies the minimum amount of data before the output is compressed). If
      the content-length is not known and compression is set to "on" or more
      aggressive, the output will also be compressed. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to "off".</p>
      <p><em>Note</em>: There is a tradeoff between using compression (saving
      your bandwidth) and using the sendfile feature (saving your CPU cycles).
      If the connector supports the sendfile feature, e.g. the NIO connector,
      using sendfile will take precedence over compression. The symptoms will
      be that static files greater that 48 Kb will be sent uncompressed.
      You can turn off sendfile by setting <code>useSendfile</code> attribute
      of the connector, as documented below, or change the sendfile usage
      threshold in the configuration of the
      <a href="../default-servlet.html">DefaultServlet</a> in the default
      <code>conf/web.xml</code> or in the <code>web.xml</code> of your web
      application.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="compressionMinSize" required="false">
      <p>If <strong>compression</strong> is set to "on" then this attribute
      may be used to specify the minimum amount of data before the output is
      compressed. If not specified, this attribute is defaults to "2048".</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionLinger" required="false">
      <p>The number of seconds during which the sockets used by this
      <strong>Connector</strong> will linger when they are closed. The default
      value is <code>-1</code> which disables socket linger.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds this <strong>Connector</strong> will wait,
      after accepting a connection, for the request URI line to be
      presented. Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.
      The default value is 60000 (i.e. 60 seconds) but note that the standard
      server.xml that ships with Tomcat sets this to 20000 (i.e. 20 seconds).
      Unless <strong>disableUploadTimeout</strong> is set to <code>false</code>,
      this timeout will also be used when reading the request body (if any).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="connectionUploadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>Specifies the timeout, in milliseconds, to use while a data upload is
      in progress. This only takes effect if
      <strong>disableUploadTimeout</strong> is set to <code>false</code>.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="disableUploadTimeout" required="false">
      <p>This flag allows the servlet container to use a different, usually
      longer connection timeout during data upload. If not specified, this
      attribute is set to <code>true</code> which disables this longer timeout.
      </p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="executor" required="false">
      <p>A reference to the name in an <a href="executor.html">Executor</a>
      element. If this attribute is set, and the named executor exists, the
      connector will use the executor, and all the other thread attributes will
      be ignored. Note that if a shared executor is not specified for a
      connector then the connector will use a private, internal executor to
      provide the thread pool.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="executorTerminationTimeoutMillis" required="false">
      <p>The time that the private internal executor will wait for request
      processing threads to terminate before continuing with the process of
      stopping the connector. If not set, the default is  <code>5000</code> (5
      seconds).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="keepAliveTimeout" required="false">
      <p>The number of milliseconds this <strong>Connector</strong> will wait
      for another HTTP request before closing the connection. The default value
      is to use the value that has been set for the
      <strong>connectionTimeout</strong> attribute.
      Use a value of -1 to indicate no (i.e. infinite) timeout.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxConnections" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of connections that the server will accept and
      process at any given time. When this number has been reached, the server
      will accept, but not process, one further connection. This additional
      connection be blocked until the number of connections being processed
      falls below <strong>maxConnections</strong> at which point the server will
      start accepting and processing new connections again. Note that once the
      limit has been reached, the operating system may still accept connections
      based on the <code>acceptCount</code> setting. The default value varies by
      connector type. For NIO and NIO2 the default is <code>10000</code>.
      For APR/native, the default is <code>8192</code>.</p>
      <p>Note that for APR/native on Windows, the configured value will be
      reduced to the highest multiple of 1024 that is less than or equal to
      maxConnections. This is done for performance reasons.<br/>
      If set to a value of -1, the maxConnections feature is disabled
      and connections are not counted.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxExtensionSize" required="false">
      <p>Limits the total length of chunk extensions in chunked HTTP requests.
      If the value is <code>-1</code>, no limit will be imposed. If not
      specified, the default value of <code>8192</code> will be used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxHttpHeaderSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum size of the request and response HTTP header, specified
      in bytes. If not specified, this attribute is set to 8192 (8 KB).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxKeepAliveRequests" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of HTTP requests which can be pipelined until
      the connection is closed by the server. Setting this attribute to 1 will
      disable HTTP/1.0 keep-alive, as well as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and
      pipelining. Setting this to -1 will allow an unlimited amount of
      pipelined or keep-alive HTTP requests.
      If not specified, this attribute is set to 100.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxSwallowSize" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of request body bytes (excluding transfer encoding
      overhead) that will be swallowed by Tomcat for an aborted upload. An
      aborted upload is when Tomcat knows that the request body is going to be
      ignored but the client still sends it. If Tomcat does not swallow the body
      the client is unlikely to see the response. If not specified the default
      of 2097152 (2 megabytes) will be used. A value of less than zero indicates
      that no limit should be enforced.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxThreads" required="false">
      <p>The maximum number of request processing threads to be created
      by this <strong>Connector</strong>, which therefore determines the
      maximum number of simultaneous requests that can be handled.  If
      not specified, this attribute is set to 200. If an executor is associated
      with this connector, this attribute is ignored as the connector will
      execute tasks using the executor rather than an internal thread pool.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="maxTrailerSize" required="false">
      <p>Limits the total length of trailing headers in the last chunk of
      a chunked HTTP request. If the value is <code>-1</code>, no limit will be
      imposed. If not specified, the default value of <code>8192</code> will be
      used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="minSpareThreads" required="false">
      <p>The minimum number of threads always kept running. If not specified,
      the default of <code>10</code> is used.</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="noCompressionUserAgents" required="false">
      <p>The value is a regular expression (using <code>java.util.regex</code>)
      matching the <code>user-agent</code> header of HTTP clients for which
      compression should not be used,
      because these clients, although they do advertise support for the
      feature, have a broken implementation.
      The default value is an empty String (regexp matching disabled).</p>
    </attribute>

    <attribute name="processorCache" required="false">
      <p>The protocol handler caches Processor objects to speed up performance.
      This setting dictates how many of these objects get cached.
      <code>-1</code> means unlimited, default is <code>200</code>. If not using
      Servlet 3.0 asynchronous processing, a good default is to use the same as

        Default value is <code>1</code> per processor but not more than 2.<br/>
        When accepting a socket, the operating system holds a global lock. So the benefit of
        going above 2 threads diminishes rapidly. Having more than one thread is for
        system that need to accept connections very rapidly. However usually just
        increasing <code>acceptCount</code> will solve that problem.
        Increasing this value may also be beneficial when a large amount of send file

<section name="Nested Components">

  <p>First implemented in Tomcat 9 and back-ported to 8.5, Tomcat now supports
  Server Name Indication (SNI). This allows multiple SSL configurations to be
  associated with a single secure connector with the configuration used for any
  given connection determined by the host name requested by the client. To
  facilitate this, the <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> element was added which
  can be used to define one of these configurations. Any number of
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> may be nested in a <strong>Connector</strong>.
  At the same time, support was added for multiple certificates to be associated
  with a single <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. Each SSL certificate is
  therefore configured in a <strong>Certificate</strong> element with in an
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. For further information, see the SSL Support
  section below.</p>

</section>


<section name="Special Features">


  <subsection name="HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 Support">

  <p>This <strong>Connector</strong> supports all of the required features
  of the HTTP/1.1 protocol, as described in RFCs 7230-7235, including persistent
  connections, pipelining, expectations and chunked encoding.  If the client
  supports only HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/0.9, the
  <strong>Connector</strong> will gracefully fall back to supporting this
  protocol as well.  No special configuration is required to enable this
  support. The <strong>Connector</strong> also supports HTTP/1.0
  keep-alive.</p>

  <p>RFC 7230 requires that HTTP servers always begin their responses with
  the highest HTTP version that they claim to support.  Therefore, this
  <strong>Connector</strong> will always return <code>HTTP/1.1</code> at
  the beginning of its responses.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="HTTP/2 Support">

  <p>HTTP/2 is support is provided for TLS (h2), non-TLS via HTTP upgrade (h2c)
     and direct HTTP/2 (h2c) connections. To enable HTTP/2 support for an HTTP
     connector the following <strong>UpgradeProtocol</strong> element must be
     nested within the <strong>Connector</strong> with a
     <strong>className</strong> attribute of
     <code>org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol</code>.</p>

<source><![CDATA[<Connector ... >
  <UpgradeProtocol className="org.apache.coyote.http2.Http2Protocol" />
</Connector>]]></source>

  <p>Because Java 8's TLS implementation does not support ALPN (which is
     required for HTTP/2 over TLS), you must be using an OpenSSL based TLS
     implementation to enable HTTP/2 support. See the
     <code>sslImplementationName</code> attribute of the
     <strong>Connector</strong>.</p>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Proxy Support">

  <p>The <code>proxyName</code> and <code>proxyPort</code> attributes can
  be used when Tomcat is run behind a proxy server.  These attributes
  modify the values returned to web applications that call the
  <code>request.getServerName()</code> and <code>request.getServerPort()</code>
  methods, which are often used to construct absolute URLs for redirects.
  Without configuring these attributes, the values returned would reflect
  the server name and port on which the connection from the proxy server
  was received, rather than the server name and port to whom the client
  directed the original request.</p>

  <p>For more information, see the
  <a href="../proxy-howto.html">Proxy Support HOW-TO</a>.</p>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="SSL Support">

  <p>You can enable SSL support for a particular instance of this
  <strong>Connector</strong> by setting the <code>SSLEnabled</code> attribute to
  <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>You will also need to set the <code>scheme</code> and <code>secure</code>
  attributes to the values <code>https</code> and <code>true</code>
  respectively, to pass correct information to the servlets.</p>

  <p>The NIO and NIO2 connectors use either the JSSE Java SSL implementation or
  an OpenSSL implementation, whereas the APR/native connector uses OpenSSL only.
  Prior to Tomcat 8.5, different configuration attributes were used for JSSE and
  OpenSSL. From Tomcat 8.5 onwards, and as far as possible, common configuration
  attributes are used for both JSSE and OpenSSL. Also if using the JSSE OpenSSL
  implementation, configuration can be set using either the JSSE or APR
  attributes (note: but not both types within the same configuration). This is
  to aid simpler switching between connector implementations for SSL
  connectors.</p>

  <p>Each secure connector must define at least one
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong>. The names of the
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> elements must be unique and one of them must
  match the <code>defaultSSLHostConfigName</code> attribute of the
  <strong>Connector</strong>.</p>

  <p>Each <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> must in turn define at least one
  <strong>Certificate</strong>. The types of the <strong>Certificate</strong>s
  must be unique.</p>

  <p>As of Tomcat 8.5, the majority of the SSL configuration attributes in the
  <strong>Connector</strong> are deprecated. If specified, they will be used to
  configure a <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> and <strong>Certificate</strong>
  for the <code>defaultSSLHostConfigName</code>. Note that if an explicit
  <strong>SSLHostConfig</strong> element also exists for the
  <code>defaultSSLHostConfigName</code> then that will be treated as a configuration
  error. It is expected that Tomcat 10 will drop support for the SSL
  configuration attributes in the <strong>Connector</strong>.</p>

      If the TLS provider doesn't support this option (OpenSSL does, JSSE does
      not) it is treated as if <code>optional</code> was specified. A

  <p>When APR/native is enabled, the connectors will default to using OpenSSL through JSSE,
  which may be more optimized than the JSSE Java implementation depending on the processor being used,
  and can be complemented with many commercial accelerator components.</p>

  <p>The following NIO and NIO2 SSL configuration attributes are not specific to
  a virtual host and, therefore, must be configured on the connector.</p>

  <attributes>

    <attribute name="sniParseLimit" required="false">
      <p>In order to implement SNI support, Tomcat has to parse the first TLS
      message received on a new TLS connection (the client hello) to extract the
      requested server name. The message needs to be buffered so it can then be
      passed to the JSSE implementation for normal TLS processing. In theory,
      this first message could be very large although in practice it is
      typically a few hundred bytes. This attribute sets the maximum message
      size that Tomcat will buffer. If a message exceeds this size, the
      connection will be configured as if no server name was indicated by the
      client. If not specified a default of <code>65536</code> (64k) will be
      used.</p>

    <attribute name="sslImplementationName" required="false">

      will be used which wraps JVM&apos;s default JSSE provider. Note that the
      JVM can be configured to use a different JSSE provider as the default.
      Tomcat also bundles a special SSL implementation for JSSE that is backed
      by OpenSSL. To enable it, the native library should be enabled as if
      intending to use the APR connector, and Tomcat will automatically enable it
      and the default value of this attribute becomes
      <code>org.apache.tomcat.util.net.openssl.OpenSSLImplementation</code>.
      In that case, the attributes from either from either JSSE and OpenSSL
      configuration styles can be used, as long as the two types are not mixed

      specify a separate pem private key using the OpenSSL attribute).</p>

  <subsection name="SSL Support - Connector - APR/Native (deprecated)">

  <p>When APR/native is enabled, the HTTPS connector will use a socket poller
  for keep-alive, increasing scalability of the server. It also uses OpenSSL,
  which may be more optimized than JSSE depending on the processor being used,
  and can be complemented with many commercial accelerator components. Unlike
  the HTTP connector, the HTTPS connector cannot use sendfile to optimize static
  file processing.</p>

  <p>The HTTPS APR/native connector has the same attributes than the HTTP
  APR/native connector, but adds OpenSSL specific ones. For the full details on
  using OpenSSL, please refer to OpenSSL documentations and the many books
  available for it (see the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">Official OpenSSL
  website</a>). The SSL specific attributes for the APR/native connector are:
