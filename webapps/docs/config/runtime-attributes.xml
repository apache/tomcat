<section name="Introduction">
  <p>The following attributes are made available to web applications at runtime.
  Many of these attributes provide access to Tomcat internals. Attributes that
  expose Tomcat internals may be explicitly requested by name but are often
  deliberately not included when requesting a list of available attributes.</p>
