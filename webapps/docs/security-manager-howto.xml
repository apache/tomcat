        <title>Security Manager HOW-TO</title>
    </properties>

<body>


<section name="Background">

  <p>The Java <strong>SecurityManager</strong> is what allows a web browser
  to run an applet in its own sandbox to prevent untrusted code from
  accessing files on the local file system, connecting to a host other
  than the one the applet was loaded from, and so on.  In the same way
  the SecurityManager protects you from an untrusted applet running in
  your browser, use of a SecurityManager while running Tomcat can protect
  your server from trojan servlets, JSPs, JSP beans, and tag libraries.
  Or even inadvertent mistakes.</p>

  <p>Imagine if someone who is authorized to publish JSPs on your site
  inadvertently included the following in their JSP:</p>
<source>
&lt;% System.exit(1); %&gt;
</source>

  <p>Every time this JSP was executed by Tomcat, Tomcat would exit.
  Using the Java SecurityManager is just one more line of defense a
  system administrator can use to keep the server secure and reliable.</p>

  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> - A security audit
  have been conducted using the Tomcat 5 codebase. Most of the critical
  package have been protected and a new security package protection mechanism 
  has been implemented. Still, make sure that you are satisfied with your SecurityManager 
  configuration before allowing untrusted users to publish web applications, 
  JSPs, servlets, beans, or tag libraries.  <strong>However, running with a 
  SecurityManager is definitely better than running without one.</strong></p>

<section name="Permissions">

  <p>Permission classes are used to define what Permissions a class loaded
  by Tomcat will have.  There are a number of Permission classes that are
  a standard part of the JDK, and you can create your own Permission class
  for use in your own web applications.  Both techniques are used in
  Tomcat 5.</p>


  <subsection name="Standard Permissions">

    <p>This is just a short summary of the standard system SecurityManager
    Permission classes applicable to Tomcat.  See
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/security/">http://java.sun.com/security/</a>
    for more information.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>java.util.PropertyPermission</strong> - Controls read/write
        access to JVM properties such as <code>java.home</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>java.lang.RuntimePermission</strong> - Controls use of
        some System/Runtime functions like <code>exit()</code> and
        <code>exec()</code>. Also control the package access/definition.</li>
    <li><strong>java.io.FilePermission</strong> - Controls read/write/execute
        access to files and directories.</li>
    <li><strong>java.net.SocketPermission</strong> - Controls use of
        network sockets.</li>
    <li><strong>java.net.NetPermission</strong> - Controls use of
        multicast network connections.</li>
    <li><strong>java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission</strong> - Controls
        use of reflection to do class introspection.</li>
    <li><strong>java.security.SecurityPermission</strong> - Controls access
        to Security methods.</li>
    <li><strong>java.security.AllPermission</strong> - Allows access to all
        permissions, just as if you were running Tomcat without a
        SecurityManager.</li>
    </ul>

  </subsection>


  <subsection name="Tomcat Custom Permissions">

    <p>Tomcat utilizes a custom permission class called
    <strong>org.apache.naming.JndiPermission</strong>.  This permission
    controls read access to JNDI named file based resources.  The permission
    name is the JNDI name and there are no actions.  A trailing "*" can be
    used to do wild card matching for a JNDI named file resource when
    granting permission.  For example, you might include the following
    in your policy file:</p>
<source>
permission  org.apache.naming.JndiPermission  "jndi://localhost/examples/*";
</source>

    <p>A Permission entry like this is generated dynamically for each web
    application that is deployed, to allow it to read its own static resources
    but disallow it from using file access to read any other files (unless
    permissions for those files are explicitly granted).</p>

    <p>Also, Tomcat always dynamically creates the following file permission:</p>
<source>  
permission java.io.FilePermission "** your application context**", "read";
</source>  
    <p>Where **your application context** equals the folder(or WAR file) under which 
    your application has been deployed. </p>  

  </subsection>

<section name="Configuring Tomcat With A SecurityManager">

  <h3>Policy File Format</h3>

  <p>The security policies implemented by the Java SecurityManager are
  configured in the <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.policy</code> file.
  This file completely replaces the <code>java.policy</code> file present
  in your JDK system directories.  The <code>catalina.policy</code> file
  can be edited by hand, or you can use the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/policytool.html">policytool</a>
  application that comes with Java 1.2 or later.</p>

  <p>Entries in the <code>catalina.policy</code> file use the standard
  <code>java.policy</code> file format, as follows:</p>
<source>
// Example policy file entry

grant [signedBy &lt;signer&gt;,] [codeBase &lt;code source&gt;] {
  permission  &lt;class&gt;  [&lt;name&gt; [, &lt;action list&gt;]];
};
</source>

  <p>The <strong>signedBy</strong> and <strong>codeBase</strong> entries are
  optional when granting permissions.  Comment lines begin with "//" and
  end at the end of the current line.  The <code>codeBase</code> is in the
  form of a URL, and for a file URL can use the <code>${java.home}</code>
  and <code>${catalina.home}</code> properties (which are expanded out to
  the directory paths defined for them by the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> and
  <code>CATALINA_HOME</code> environment variables).</p>

  <h3>The Default Policy File</h3>

  <p>The default <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.policy</code> file
  looks like this:</p>
<source>
// ============================================================================
// catalina.corepolicy - Security Policy Permissions for Tomcat 5
//
// This file contains a default set of security policies to be enforced (by the
// JVM) when Catalina is executed with the "-security" option.  In addition
// to the permissions granted here, the following additional permissions are
// granted to the codebase specific to each web application:
//
// * Read access to the document root directory
//
// $Id: security-manager-howto.xml 301460 2003-01-15 03:40:45Z glenn $
// ============================================================================


// ========== SYSTEM CODE PERMISSIONS =========================================


// These permissions apply to javac
grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/lib/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to all shared system extensions
grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/jre/lib/ext/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to javac when ${java.home] points at $JAVA_HOME/jre
grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/../lib/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to all shared system extensions when
// ${java.home} points at $JAVA_HOME/jre
grant codeBase "file:${java.home}/lib/ext/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};


// ========== CATALINA CODE PERMISSIONS =======================================


// These permissions apply to the launcher code
grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/bin/commons-launcher.jar" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to the server startup code
grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/bin/bootstrap.jar" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to the servlet API classes
// and those that are shared across all class loaders
// located in the "common" directory
grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/common/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// These permissions apply to the container's core code, plus any additional
// libraries installed in the "server" directory
grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/server/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

// ========== WEB APPLICATION PERMISSIONS =====================================


// These permissions are granted by default to all web applications
// In addition, a web application will be given a read FilePermission
// and JndiPermission for all files and directories in its document root.
grant { 
        // Required for JNDI lookup of named JDBC DataSource's and
        // javamail named MimePart DataSource used to send mail
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.home", "read";
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.naming.*", "read";
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "javax.sql.*", "read";

        // OS Specific properties to allow read access
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "os.name", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "os.version", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "os.arch", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "file.separator", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "path.separator", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "line.separator", "read";

        // JVM properties to allow read access
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.version", "read";
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vendor", "read";
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vendor.url", "read";
        permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.class.version", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.specification.version", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.specification.vendor", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.specification.name", "read";

	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.specification.version", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.specification.vendor", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.specification.name", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.version", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.vendor", "read";
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "java.vm.name", "read";

        // Required for getting BeanInfo
        permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessClassInPackage.sun.beans.*";

        // Required for OpenJMX
        permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "getAttribute";

	// Allow read of JAXP compliant XML parser debug
	permission java.util.PropertyPermission "jaxp.debug", "read";
};


// You can assign additional permissions to particular web applications by
// adding additional "grant" entries here, based on the code base for that
// application, /WEB-INF/classes/, or /WEB-INF/lib/ jar files.
//
// Different permissions can be granted to JSP pages, classes loaded from
// the /WEB-INF/classes/ directory, all jar files in the /WEB-INF/lib/
// directory, or even to individual jar files in the /WEB-INF/lib/ directory.
//
// For instance, assume that the standard "examples" application
// included a JDBC driver that needed to establish a network connection to the
// corresponding database and used the scrape taglib to get the weather from
// the NOAA web server.  You might create a "grant" entries like this:
//
// The permissions granted to the context root directory apply to JSP pages.
// grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/-" {
//      permission java.net.SocketPermission "dbhost.mycompany.com:5432", "connect";
//      permission java.net.SocketPermission "*.noaa.gov:80", "connect";
// };
//
// The permissions granted to the context WEB-INF/classes directory
// grant codeBase "file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/-" {
// };
//
// The permission granted to your JDBC driver
// grant codeBase "jar:file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib/driver.jar!/-" {
//      permission java.net.SocketPermission "dbhost.mycompany.com:5432", "connect";
// };
// The permission granted to the scrape taglib
// grant codeBase "jar:file:${catalina.home}/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/lib/scrape.jar!/-" {
//      permission java.net.SocketPermission "*.noaa.gov:80", "connect";
// };
</source>

  <h3>Starting Tomcat With A SecurityManager</h3>

  <p>Once you have configured the <code>catalina.policy</code> file for use
  with a SecurityManager, Tomcat can be started with a SecurityManager in
  place by using the "-security" option:</p>
<source>
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh start -security    (Unix)
%CATALINA_HOME%\bin\catalina start -security      (Windows)
</source>

</section>
<section name="Configuring Package Protection in Tomcat">
  <p>Starting with Tomcat 5, it is now possible to configure which Tomcat
  internal package are protected againts package definition and access. See
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html">
    http://java.sun.com/security/seccodeguide.html</a>
    for more information.</p>    

  
  <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Be aware that removing the default package protection 
  could possibly open a security hole</p>

  <h3>The Default Properties File</h3>

  <p>The default <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.properties</code> file
  looks like this:</p>
<source>  
#
# List of comma-separated packages that start with or equal this string
# will cause a security exception to be thrown when
# passed to checkPackageAccess unless the
# corresponding RuntimePermission ("accessClassInPackage."+package) has
# been granted.
package.access=sun.,org.apache.catalina.,org.apache.coyote.,org.apache.tomcat.,
org.apache.jasper.
#
# List of comma-separated packages that start with or equal this string
# will cause a security exception to be thrown when
# passed to checkPackageDefinition unless the
# corresponding RuntimePermission ("defineClassInPackage."+package) has
# been granted.
#
# by default, no packages are restricted for definition, and none of
# the class loaders supplied with the JDK call checkPackageDefinition.
#
package.definition=sun.,java.,org.apache.catalina.,org.apache.coyote.,
org.apache.tomcat.,org.apache.jasper.
</source>
  <p>Once you have configured the <code>catalina.properties</code> file for use
  with a SecurityManager, remember to re-start Tomcat.</p>
</section>

<section name="Troubleshooting">

  <p>If your web application attempts to execute an operation that is
  prohibited by lack of a required Permission, it will throw an
  <code>AccessControLException</code> or a <code>SecurityException</code>
  when the SecurityManager detects the violation.  Debugging the permission
  that is missing can be challenging, and one option is to turn on debug
  output of all security decisions that are made during execution.  This
  is done by setting a system property before starting Tomcat.  The easiest
  way to do this is via the <code>CATALINA_OPTS</code> environment variable.
  Execute this command:</p>
<source>
export CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.security.debug=all    (Unix)
set CATALINA_OPTS=-Djava.security.debug=all       (Windows)
</source>

  <p>before starting Tomcat.</p>

  <p><strong>WARNING</strong> - This will generate <em>many megabytes</em>
  of output!  However, it can help you track down problems by searching
  for the word "FAILED" and determining which permission was being checked
  for.  See the Java security documentation for more options that you can
  specify here as well.</p>
