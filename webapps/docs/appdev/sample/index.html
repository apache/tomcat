<h2>Sample Application</h2>
      <p> 
        The example app has been packaged as a war file and can be downloaded 
        <a href="sample.war">here</a> (Note: make sure your browser doesn't 
        change file extension or append a new one).
      </p>
      <p> 
        The easiest way to run this application is simply to move the war file 
        to your <b>CATALINA_HOME/webapps</b> directory. Tomcat will automatically 
        expand and deploy the application for you. You can view it with the 
        following URL (assuming that you're running tomcat on port 8080 
        as is the default):
        <br />
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/sample">http://localhost:8080/sample</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you just want to browse the code you can unpack the war file 
        with the <b>jar</b> command.
        <source>
          jar -xvf sample.war
        </source>
      </p>
