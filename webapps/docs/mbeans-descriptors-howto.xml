<section name="Introduction">

<p>Tomcat uses JMX MBeans as the technology for implementing
manageability of Tomcat.</p>

<p>The descriptions of JMX MBeans for Catalina are in the mbeans-descriptors.xml
file in each package.</p>

<p>You will need to add MBean descriptions for your custom components
in order to avoid a "ManagedBean is not found" exception.</p>

</section>

<section name="Adding MBean descriptions">

<p>You may also add MBean descriptions for custom components in
an mbeans-descriptors.xml file, located in the same package as the class files
it describes.</p>

<p>The permitted syntax for the mbeans-descriptors.xml is defined by
the <a href="mbeans-descriptors.dtd">DTD</a> file.</p>

<p>The entries for a custom LDAP authentication Realm may look like this:</p>

<source><![CDATA[  <mbean         name="LDAPRealm"
            className="org.apache.catalina.mbeans.ClassNameMBean"
          description="Custom LDAPRealm"
               domain="Catalina"
                group="Realm"
                 type="com.myfirm.mypackage.LDAPRealm">

    <attribute   name="className"
          description="Fully qualified class name of the managed object"
                 type="java.lang.String"
            writeable="false"/>

    <attribute   name="debug"
          description="The debugging detail level for this component"
                 type="int"/>
    .
    .
    .
