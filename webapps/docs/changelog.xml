  Subsection ordering:

  Item Ordering:

  Fixes having an issue number are sorted by their number, ascending.

  There is no ordering by add/update/fix/scode.

  Other fixed issues are added to the end of the list, chronologically.
  They eventually become mixed with the numbered issues. (I.e., numbered
  issues do not "pop up" wrt. others).

  <subsection name="Catalina">
    <changelog>
      <scode>
        Refactor creation of <code>MapperListener</code> to ensure that the
        <code>Mapper</code> used is the <code>Mapper</code> associated with the
        <code>Service</code> for which the listener was created. (markt)
      </scode>
      <add>
        Move the functionality that provides redirects for context roots and
        directories where a trailing <code>/</code> is added from the Mapper to
        the <code>DefaultServlet</code>. This enables such requests to be
        processed by any configured Valves and Filters before the redirect is
        made. This behaviour is configurable via the
        <code>mapperContextRootRedirectEnabled</code> and
        <code>mapperDirectoryRedirectEnabled</code> attributes of the Context
        which may be used to restore the previous behaviour. (markt)
      </add>
      <scode>
        Refactor <code>Service.getContainer()</code> to return an
        <code>Engine</code> rather than a <code>Container</code>. (markt)
      </scode>
      <fix>
        <bug>34319</bug>: Only load those keys in <code>StoreBase.processExpire</code>
        from JDBCStore, that are old enough, to be expired. Based on a patch
        by Tom Anderson. (fschumacher)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        <bug>58629</bug>: Allow an embedded Tomcat instance to start when the
        <code>Service</code> has no <code>Engine</code> configured. (markt)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        Correctly notify the MapperListener associated with a Service if the
        Engine for that Service is changed. (markt)
      </fix>
      <add>
        Make a web application's CredentialHandler available through a context
        attribute. This allows a web application to use the same algorithm
        for validating or generating new stored credentials from cleartext
        ones. (schultz)
      </add>
    </changelog>
  </subsection>
  <subsection name="Coyote">
    <changelog>
      <fix>
        <bug>58621</bug>: The certificate chain cannot be set using the main
        certificate attribute, so restore the certificate chain property. (remm)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        Allow a new SSL config type where a connector can use either JSSE or
        OpenSSL. Both could be allowed, but it would likely create support
        issues. This type is used by the OpenSSL implementation for NIOx. (remm)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        Improve upgrade context classloader handling by using Context.bind and
        unbind. (remm)

        Fix potential integer overflow in <code>DeltaSession</code>.
        Reported by coverity scan. (fschumacher)

  <subsection name="WebSocket">
    <changelog>
      <add>
        <bug>55006</bug>: The WebSocket client now honors the
        <code>java.net.java.net.ProxySelector</code> configuration (using the
        HTTP type) when establishing WebSocket connections to servers. Based on
        a patch by Niki Dokovski. (markt)
      </add>
      <fix>
        <bug>58624</bug>: Correct a potential deadlock if the WebSocket
        connection is closed when a message write is in progress. (markt)

    <changelog>
      <fix>
        Ensure that the static member is registered to the add suspect list even
        if the static member that is registered to the remove suspect list has
        disappeared. (kfujino)
      </fix>
      <fix>
        When using a static cluster, add the members that have been cached in
        the membership service to the map members list in order to ensure that
        the map member is a static member. (kfujino)

    <changelog>

        Correct evaluation of system property <code>org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.onlyAttemptCurrentClassLoader</code>.

        Tighten up the default file permissions for the <code>.tar.gz</code>
        distribution so no files or directories are world readable by default.
        Configure Tomcat to run with a default umask of <code>0027</code> which
        may be overridden by setting <code>UMASK</code> in
        <code>setenv.sh</code>. (markt)

        Based on code contributed by Numa de Montmollin and derived from code

      </add>
      <fix>
        RFC 7230 states that clients should ignore reason phrases in HTTP/1.1
        response messages. Since the reason phrase is optional, Tomcat no longer
        sends it. As a result the system property
        <code>org.apache.coyote.USE_CUSTOM_STATUS_MSG_IN_HEADER</code> is no
        longer used and has been removed. (markt)
      </fix>
