Building from source package
-----------------------------

>  configure --with-apr=apr_install_location --with-ssl=openssl_install_location
>  make

Building from the svn tree
--------------------------

>  sh buildconf --with-apr=apr_source_location.
>  configure --with-apr=apr_install_location --with-ssl=openssl_install_location
>  make

Testing the build
-----------------

The make should produce a .so file named libtcnative-1.so.
Build the jar containing the examples by

> cd ..
>  ant jar
  Run one of the example (the echo one):
>  ant run-echo
 
Using it in Tomcat
------------------

1. In <Connector> use of conf/server.xml:
   protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol"
2. In bin/setenv.sh add the following:
   CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Djava.library.path=tclib_location"
   In my machine I am using:
   /home/jfclere/native/native/.libs for tclib_location

NOTES
-----
  - configure --disable-openssl: Configure without ssl support.
  - To use it in Tomcat you may have to add in bin/setenv.sh:
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=openssl_install_location/lib; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    (use ldd ./.libs/libtcnative-1.so to check it).
  - quick testing: openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443
  - For MAC OS X you must manually add a link
    cd ${tcnative installdir}
    ln -d libtcnative-1.dylib libtcnative-1.jnilib


Building statically linked library on unixes
--------------------------------------------

To statically link apr and openssl dependencies use the following
procedure.

You will need to build static version of openssl library.

> ./config --prefix=~/natives/openssl no-shared -fPIC
> make
> make install_sw

Note that for solaris platform you should use -KPIC instead -fPIC
so that library is compiled with position independent code.

Apr by default build both static and synamic libraries.

> ./configure --prefix=~/natives/apr
> make
> make install

After that edit the ~/natives/apr/lib/libapr-1.la file
and comment or delete the following sections:
dlname='...' and library_names='...'
This is needed so that libtool picks the static version of the library.

Build Tomcat native by executing

> ./configure --with-apr=~/natives/apr --with-ssl=~/natives/openssl --prefix=~/natives/tomcat
> make
> make install

Thats it. You have just build libtchative-1.so with statically linked
apr and openssl.
