<section name="Introduction">

  <p>
    The Apache Tomcat Native Library is an optional component for use with
    Apache Tomcat that allows Tomcat to use certain native resources
    for performance, compatibility, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Specifically, the Apache Tomcat Native Library gives Tomcat access to
    the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection (socket)
    implementation and random-number generator.
    See the Apache Tomcat documentation for more information on how to
    configure Tomcat to use the APR connector.
  </p>

  <p>
    Features of the APR connector:
    <ul>
      <li>Non-blocking I/O for Keep-Alive requests (between requests)</li>
      <li>Uses OpenSSL for TLS/SSL capabilities (if supported by linked APR library)</li>
      <li>FIPS 140-2 support for TLS/SSL (if supported by linked OpenSSL library)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<section name="Building">
<subsection name="Requirements">
    <p>
      Build tc-native requires three components to be installed:
      <ul>
        <li>APR library</li>
        <li>OpenSSL libraries</li>
        <li>Java SE Development Kit (JDK)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
     In debian based Linux those dependencies could be installed by something like:
      <pre>
        apt-get install libapr1.0-dev libssl-dev
      </pre>
     In rpm based Linux those dependencies could be installed by something like:
      <pre>
        yum install apr-devel openssl-devel
      </pre>
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="UNIX">
  <p>
    On all the POSIX systems (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc...) a well-known
    configure and make is used to build tc-native.<br/>
    In the jni/native runs:<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --help
    </pre>
    to read the description of all the parameters.<br/>
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=$HOME/APR \
                --with-java-home=$JAVA_HOME \
                --with-ssl=$HOME/OPENSSL \
                --prefix=$CATALINA_HOME
    </pre>
    to create the includes and makefiles to be able to build tc-native.<br/>
    Where:<br/>
    $HOME/APR is something like /usr/bin/apr-1-config or the path where apr is
    installed.<br/>
    $JAVA_HOME is something /home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09 path to a JDK
    installation. Any JDK should work but it is advisable to use the same
    JVM version the JVM you use with Tomcat.<br/>
    $HOME/OPENSSL is the path where OpenSSL is installed.<br/>
    $CATALINA_HOME is the path where the produced libraries will be installed. Something like $HOME/apache-tomcat-6.0.16/<br/>
    <br/>
    The configure is able to guess most of OpenSSL standard installations.
    So most of the time the following will be enough:
    <pre>
    ./configure --with-apr=/usr/bin/apr-1-config \
                --with-java-home=/home/jfclere/JAVA/jdk1.5.0_09/ \
                --with-ssl=yes \
                --prefix=$CATALINA_HOME
    </pre>
    <br/>
    To build the libraries and install them:<br/>
    <pre>
    make &amp;&amp; make install
    </pre>
    The libraries will be found in $CATALINA_HOME/lib
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Windows">
  <p>
   Download the windows sources of tc-native and extract them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download OpenSSL sources (See <a href="http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html"><b>Binary Distributions</b></a>)
    OpenSSL is a crypto software so check if you are allowed to download it. If not you can still use tc-native without SSL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Download APR sources for Windows. (See <a href="http://apr.apache.org/download.cgi"><b>Download</b></a>)
    Extract them in jni and rename the apr-1.x.y directory to apr.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use MS Visual Studio to open the workspace of the APR sources and build the library (libapr).
  </p>
  <p>
    Use MS Visual Studio to open the workspace of the tc-native sources, adjust the OpenSSL includes and libraries location
    change the name of the libraries libeay32 and libssleay to libeay32MT and libssleayMT and build the tcn-native library.
    That should create a tcnative-1.dll.

<section name="Install and tests">
  <subsection name="Configuring Tomcat">
    <p>
      Apache Tomcat comes with the <code>AprLifecycleListener</code> enabled
      by default. Still, you should check your <code>conf/server.xml</code>
      to ensure that something like the following is present, and uncommented:
    </p>

    <pre>
      &lt;Listener className="org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener" SSLEngine="on" /&gt;
    </pre>

    Please see the Apache Tomcat documentation for configuration specifics.
  </subsection>

<subsection name="UNIX">
  <p>
   Edit $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh (creating the file if necessary) and add
   the path to the tc-native libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Something like:
   <pre>
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CATALINA_HOME/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   </pre>
   Start tomcat and check for the messages like this ones:
   <pre>
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
    INFO: Loaded APR based Apache Tomcat Native library 1.x.y.
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
    INFO: APR capabilities: IPv6 [true], sendfile [true], accept filters [false], random [true].
    Feb 8, 2008 12:27:41 PM org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol init
    INFO: Initializing Coyote HTTP/1.1 on http-8080
   </pre>
    Refer to the tomcat documentation to configure the connectors
    (See <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/apr.html">Tomcat6.0.x</a>
    and  <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/apr.html">Tomcat5.5.x</a>)
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Windows">
  <p>
    Edit $CATALINA_BASE\bin\setenv.bat (creating the file if necessary) and add
    the path to the tc-native libraries, apr and OpenSSL to PATH. For example:
  <p>

  <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap; word-wrap:break-word;">
    set PATH=%PATH;C:\cygwin\home\support\tomcat-native-current-win32-src\jni\native\Debug;C:\cygwin\home\support\tomcat-native-current-win32-src\jni\apr\Debug;C:\OpenSSL\lib\VC
  </pre>
  <p>
    Start tomcat and check for the messages like this ones:
  </p>
  <pre>
    Feb 8, 2008 2:48:17 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
    INFO: Loaded APR based Apache Tomcat Native library 1.x.y.
    Feb 8, 2008 2:48:17 PM org.apache.catalina.core.AprLifecycleListener init
