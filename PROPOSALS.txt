                           Apache Tomcat Trunk Proposals
                         =================================


PATCHES PROPOSED FOR INCLUSION in 6.1.x:
  [ The alpha/beta branch that will be the basis of the stable 6.2.x releases ]
  [ No date has been set for the creation of a 6.1.x branch at this point ]
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* catalina-tribes.jar improvements
Messaging
=========
Add in support for UDP messages
 - fire and forget
 - ack on message
 - ack on batch of messages
 - periodic ack, time or message count
 - support multicast fire and forget
 - autoswitch TCP/UDP based on size, number of recipients, or on message flag
 - add in versioning to the message structure
 - Add in a delay between bind failures, to give the JVM a chance to recover
Priority Messaging
 - Being able to send through high priority messages through a channel
   pause existing messages

Failure Detection
=================
Improvements to the current failure detector
 - NIO based
 - avoid multiple member failed messages, keep a lock on a recipient basis
 - different levels of failure check (accept, send/receive ack)
Networking
==========
Add in support to leverage multiple network cards in parallel (research 
if any OS features are available to leverage this)

Performance/Concurrency
=======================
 - Remove usage of "synchronized" (previously used for JDK 1.4 compatibility)
 - make JDK 1.5 minimum version
 - take advantage of java.util.concurrent
 
Membership
==========
 - implement payloadChange(...) event on membership listener
 
* Make OSGi Bundles of each jar

* Include tomcat-juli and tomcat-juli-adapters as an add on package when doing a release

* Generate source jars for each maven jar posted

Session Replication
===================
- New feature - only replicate upon demand
  Runtime tomcat doesn't do live session replication
  but you can move the sessions upon demand before shutting down a tomcat instance
  and draining sessions
  
* Make it easier to embed tomcat, run it without config files and special layout:
  - add a helper class to allow tomcat to be run without any external config 
  files.
  - add unit test as example
  - add a target to generate a 'fat' jar with all dependencies and 
  a minimal 'main'
