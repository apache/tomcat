Apache Tomcat re-uses code from a number of other Apache projects. There are
several reasons why depending on the binary releases of those projects is not
ideal. These include:
- potential conflicts if a web application ships with the same JAR
- a large JAR where Tomcat only depends on a small fraction


SVN
===

For sources hosted in svn the approach is to svn copy the classes to the Tomcat
source tree, modify them (always with a package rename, sometimes with
additional changes) and then keep them in sync with the original via regular svn
merges. This file keeps track of these copies to assist committers in keeping
them up to date.

BCEL
----
org.apache.tomcat.util.bcel is copied from:
/commons/proper/bcel/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/bcel

Codec
-----
org.apache.tomcat.util.codec is copied from:
/commons/proper/codec/trunk/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/codec/
Note: Only classes required for Base64 encoding/decoding. The rest are removed.


GIT
===

Updates from Git are applied manually via patch files. Patch files are generated
using:
git diff <last SHA1>:<sub-tree> HEAD:<sub-tree> > temp.patch
The most recently merged SHA1 for the component below should be updated after
the patch file has been applied and committed

FileUpload
----------
Sub-tree:
src/main/java/org/apache/commons/fileupload
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
b1498c9877d751f8bc4635a6f252ebdfcba28518

Note: Tomcat's copy of fileupload also includes classes copied manually (rather
      than svn copied) from Commons IO.

DBCP
----
DBCP2
Sub-tree
src/main/java/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
src/main/resources/org/apache/commons/dbcp2
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
abc048454398d8c9924a1af9c04501817f44a11d

Pool2
Sub-tree
src/main/java/org/apache/commons/pool2
The SHA1 ID for the most recent commit to be merged to Tomcat is:
3e02523b6907fb22f3582544fe362c785821bcb8
