                        TODO


SSL Renegotiation
-----------------

It is unclear to me, what the current state is. It looks like we support
the unsafe legacy reneg whenever the OpenSSL used during build time
supports it. There is no configuration option to switch it off during
runtime. Right?

Is it correct, that client initiated reneg is not supported and thus the
known attacks will not work even with old OpenSSL?

Should we add a remark about this topic to the docs?


Java Tests and Examples
-----------------------

- "ant run-echo": what is the expected behaviour of this example.
  I couldn't get it to do something understandable.
  Document the example in the README.txt.

- "ant run-ssl-server": Could't we include a test certificate in the
  distribution?

- "ant run-ssl-server": What should the test produce, if run successfully?
  Document the example in the README.txt.

- "ant run-local-server": Creates a unix socket "\\.\PIPE\test" in the
  examples directory, then waits. How is the test expected to work?
  And the file name doesn't seem to be appropriate for Unix.
  Document the example in the README.txt.


Java Classes Source Distribution
--------------------------------

Check on how to handle the test and examples classes.
I think they have no other home.

Furthermore some of the Java files do not exist inside TC:
- Apr.java, apr.properties, jni/Buffer.java and jni/Thread.java
I don't know their purpose and whether we can delete them.


Releasing
---------

- Document how to release.

- Add info about updating config.guess and config.sub from 

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.guess;hb=HEAD
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=config.git;a=blob_plain;f=config.sub;hb=HEAD

- ZIP download seems to have group write permissions set
  (at least after I extract it on Solaris).
  It's a bit strange that permissions differ between the
  tar and zip archives.

- OCSP enabled Windows binary
  - Document build
  - Use consistent naming
    (1.1.22 used ...win32-ocsp..., 1.1.24 used ...ocsp-win32...)


Trunk
-----

Trunk isn't really maintained. A lot of merges
need to be done. AFAIK the trunk native classes
contain some additions, so we can't simply remove trunk.

Change release layout when releasing trunk: don't insert
the additional "jni" directory, instead keep layout in sync
between svn and source distribution.
