     * There is no VALUE option since the Servlet specification does not permit the creation of a Cookie with a name
     * that is either null or the zero length string.
     *
     * In RFC 2019, cookie name and value were defined as follows:
     *    cookie          =       NAME "=" VALUE *(";" cookie-av)
     *    NAME            =       attr
     *    VALUE           =       value
     *    attr            =       token
     *    value           =       word
     *    And from RFC 2068
     *    token           =       1*<any CHAR except CTLs or tspecials>
     *    word            =       *TEXT
     * Set-Cookie and Cookie used the same definition.
     * Name had to be at least one character, equals sign was required, value could be the empty string.
     *
     * In RFC 2965, the definition of value changed to:
     *    value           =       token | quoted-string
     * Set-Cookie2 and Cookie use the same definition.
     * Name had to be at least one character, equals sign was required, value could not be the empty string (it could
     * be "").
     *
     * In RFC6265, which aimed to document actual usage, cookie name and value are defined as follows:
     *   cookie-pair      = cookie-name "=" cookie-value
     *   cookie-name      = token
     *   cookie-value     = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )
     * For the user agent, the equals sign was required and cookies with no name were ignored.
     *
     * In RFC6265bis, the definitions are unchanged.
     * For the user agent:
     *  - a name-value-pair without an equals sign is treated as the value of a cookie with an empty name.
     *  - both empty name and empty value are allowed but if both are empty the cookie will be ignored.
     * @formatter:on
     *
     * To see how RFC6265 arrived at his behaviour, see https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/159
     *
     * Historically, the users agents settled on using a name-value-pair without an equals sign to indicate a cookie
     * with a value but no name. Tomcat did the opposite. That arose from addressing this bug:
     * https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49000 which was based on observed but not understood client
     * behaviour.
     *
     * The current RFC6265bis text explicitly treats a name-value-pair without an equals sign as a cookie with a value
     * but no name. There are currently no plans for the Servlet specification to support nameless cookies.
     *
     * At some point it is expected that this class will be deprecated and then removed and the current default of
     * IGNORE will become the hard-coded behaviour.
