engine.failedToReadAvailableBytes=There are plain text bytes available to read but no bytes were read
engine.inboundClose=Inbound closed before receiving peer's close_notify
engine.invalidBufferArray=offset: [{0}], length: [{1}] (expected: offset <= offset + length <= srcs.length [{2}])
engine.invalidDestinationBuffersState=The state of the destination buffers changed concurrently while unwrapping bytes
engine.noRestrictSessionCreation=OpenSslEngine does not permit restricting the engine to only resuming existing sessions
engine.noSSLContext=No SSL context
