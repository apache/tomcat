/**
 * ManagedConnection is responsible for managing a database connection in a transactional environment (typically called
 * "Container Managed"). A managed connection operates like any other connection when no global transaction (a.k.a. XA
 * transaction or JTA Transaction) is in progress. When a global transaction is active a single physical connection to
 * the database is used by all ManagedConnections accessed in the scope of the transaction. Connection sharing means
 * that all data access during a transaction has a consistent view of the database. When the global transaction is
 * committed or rolled back the enlisted connections are committed or rolled back. Typically, upon transaction
 * completion, a connection returns to the auto commit setting in effect before being enlisted in the transaction, but
 * some vendors do not properly implement this.
 * <p>
 * When enlisted in a transaction the setAutoCommit(), commit(), rollback(), and setReadOnly() methods throw a
 * SQLException. This is necessary to assure that the transaction completes as a single unit.
 * </p>
