/**
 * An interface defining life-cycle methods for instances to be served by an
 * {@link ObjectPool}.
 * <p>
 * By contract, when an {@link ObjectPool} delegates to a
 * {@link PooledObjectFactory},
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #makeObject} is called whenever a new instance is needed.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #activateObject} is invoked on every instance that has been
 *   {@link #passivateObject passivated} before it is
 *   {@link ObjectPool#borrowObject borrowed} from the pool.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #validateObject} may be invoked on {@link #activateObject activated}
 *   instances to make sure they can be {@link ObjectPool#borrowObject borrowed}
 *   from the pool. {@link #validateObject} may also be used to
 *   test an instance being {@link ObjectPool#returnObject returned} to the pool
 *   before it is {@link #passivateObject passivated}. It will only be invoked
 *   on an activated instance.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #passivateObject} is invoked on every instance when it is returned
 *   to the pool.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *   {@link #destroyObject} is invoked on every instance when it is being
 *   "dropped" from the pool (whether due to the response from
 *   {@link #validateObject}, or for reasons specific to the pool
 *   implementation.) There is no guarantee that the instance being destroyed
 *   will be considered active, passive or in a generally consistent state.
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
 * {@link PooledObjectFactory} must be thread-safe. The only promise
 * an {@link ObjectPool} makes is that the same instance of an object will not
 * be passed to more than one method of a {@code PoolableObjectFactory}
 * at a time.
 * <p>
 * While clients of a {@link KeyedObjectPool} borrow and return instances of
 * the underlying value type {@code V}, the factory methods act on instances of
 * {@link PooledObject PooledObject&lt;V&gt;}.  These are the object wrappers that
 * pools use to track and maintain state information about the objects that
 * they manage.
