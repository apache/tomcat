/**
 * Represents the complete set of resources for a web application. The resources for a web application comprise of
 * multiple ResourceSets and when looking for a Resource, the ResourceSets are processed in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Pre - Resources defined by the &lt;PreResource&gt; element in the web application's context.xml. Resources will
 * be searched in the order they were specified.</li>
 * <li>Main - The main resources for the web application - i.e. the WAR or the directory containing the expanded
 * WAR</li>
 * <li>JARs - Resource JARs as defined by the Servlet specification. JARs will be searched in the order they were added
 * to the ResourceRoot.</li>
 * <li>Post - Resources defined by the &lt;PostResource&gt; element in the web application's context.xml. Resources will
 * be searched in the order they were specified.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The following conventions should be noted:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Write operations (including delete) will only be applied to the main ResourceSet. The write operation will fail
 * if the presence of a Resource in one of the other ResourceSets effectively makes the operation on the main
 * ResourceSet a NO-OP.</li>
 * <li>A file in a ResourceSet will hide a directory of the same name (and all the contents of that directory) in a
 * ResourceSet that is later in the search order.</li>
 * <li>Only the main ResourceSet may define a META-INF/context.xml since that file defines the Pre- and
 * Post-Resources.</li>
 * <li>As per the Servlet specification, any META-INF or WEB-INF directories in a resource JAR will be ignored.</li>
 * <li>Pre- and Post-Resources may define WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes in order to make additional libraries and/or
 * classes available to the web application.
 * </ul>
 * This mechanism replaces and extends the following features that were present in earlier versions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Aliases - Replaced by Post-Resources with the addition of support for single files as well as directories and
 * JARs.</li>
 * <li>VirtualWebappLoader - Replaced by Pre- and Post-Resources mapped to WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes</li>
 * <li>VirtualDirContext - Replaced by Pre- and Post-Resources</li>
 * <li>External repositories - Replaced by Pre- and Post-Resources mapped to WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes</li>
 * <li>Resource JARs - Same feature but implemented using the same mechanism as all the other additional resources.</li>
 * </ul>
 */
/*
 * A potential future enhancement is to allow writing to any ResourceSet, not just the main ResourceSet although that
 * adds all sorts complications including: - which ResourceSet to write to - unexpected behaviour when deleting a
 * resource from one ResourceSet since that may unmask a resource in a lower priority ResourceSet so what was a delete
 * looks like a replace with the user having no idea where the 'new' resource came from - how to handle PUT when the
 * target is read-only but it could be written to a higher priority ResourceSet that is read-write
