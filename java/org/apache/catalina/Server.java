 * Normally, an implementation of this interface will also implement
 * <code>Lifecycle</code>, such that when the <code>start()</code> and
 * <code>stop()</code> methods are called, all of the defined
 * <code>Services</code> are also started or stopped.
 * <p>
 * In between, the implementation must open a server socket on the port number
 * specified by the <code>port</code> property.  When a connection is accepted,
 * the first line is read and compared with the specified shutdown command.
 * If the command matches, shutdown of the server is initiated.
