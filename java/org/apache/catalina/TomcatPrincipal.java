     * simple extra additional metadata. It is recommended that a container level object is used to further process the
     * attributes that may be associated with the <code>Principal</code>.
     * <p>
     * <code>Realm</code> implementations that are provided by Tomcat will not provide complex type mapping, but will in
     * most cases always return a result as a <code>String</code> object which may need custom decoding.
     * <p>
     * <code>Realm</code> implementations that are provided by Tomcat will not provide an implementation for this
     * facility unless it is inherent to the storage backend of the <code>Realm</code> itself and metadata is available
     * without additional user intervention or configuration.
